3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
However, You may include an additional document offering the
additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
must be made available in Source Code form under the terms
of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism
to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You
are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

(a) Third Party Claims.

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim
and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains
such knowledge after the Modification is made available as
described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.

If Contributor's Modifications include an application
programming interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge
of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in
a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
documentation for the Source Code where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered
Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that
Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how
and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms
of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered
Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You
must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except
to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered
Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or
new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version
of the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has
the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.

If You create or use a modified version of this License
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is
not already Covered Code governed by this License), You
must: (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Sun,"
"Sun Public License," or "SPL" or any confusingly similar
phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains
terms which differ from the Sun Public License. (Filling in
the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not
of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS''
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered
Code which are properly granted shall survive any
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action
is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in
writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim
with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon
in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into
account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
above,  all end user license agreements (excluding
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted
by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
License shall be governed by California law provisions
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
the United States of America, any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with
venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the
losing party responsible for costs, including without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against
the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each
party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall
be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code
as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the
Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the
Covered Code under Your choice of the alternative licenses,
if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
described in Exhibit A.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create
additional classes to, or modifications of, the Java
technology, except under compatibility requirements
available under a separate agreement available at
www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open
source developers, and thanks the community for its
important contributions and open standards-based technology,
which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with
notices and open source licenses from such communities and
third parties that govern the use of those portions, and any
licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and
obligations you may have under such open source licenses,
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all
Software in this distribution.

7. Term and Termination. 

The license and service term are set forth in your
Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will
terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
materially breach it or take any action in derogation of
Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may
terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in
Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a
claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to
Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination
of the Agreement.

8. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the
date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the
media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.
Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your
exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this
limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software
media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do
not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the
above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you
specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from
state to state.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE
LEGALLY INVALID. 

10. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR
ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR
DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for
Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations
will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of
incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms
above may not be applicable to you. 

11. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other
materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S.
export control laws and may be subject to export or import
regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly
with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you
have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export,
re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to
you. 

12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.
Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or
subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in
Software and accompanying documentation will be only as set
forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR
227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
acquisitions). 

13. Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by
California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice
of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. 

14. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the
provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

15. Integration. 

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your
Entitlement, is the entire agreement between you and Sun
relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties
relating to its subject matter during the term of this
Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be
binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of each party.
