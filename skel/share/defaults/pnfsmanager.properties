# Cell name of pnfsmanager service
pnfsmanager.cell.name=PnfsManager

#  ---- Whether to export the pnfsmanager cell as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the pnfsmanager cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.
(one-of?true|false)pnfsmanager.cell.export=true

#   -- replace with org.dcache.chimera.namespace.ChimeraEnstoreStorageInfoExtractor
#      if you are running an enstore HSM backend.
#
pnfsmanager.plugins.storage-info-extractor = org.dcache.chimera.namespace.ChimeraOsmStorageInfoExtractor

#  ---- Number of threads per thread group
#
#   Depending on how powerful your chimera server host is you may set
#   this to up to 50.
#
pnfsmanager.limits.threads-per-group = 12

#  ---- Number of thread groups
#
#   A PNFS tree may be split into multiple databases. Each database is
#   single threaded and hence accessing the same database from
#   multiple threads provides only a minor speed-up. To ensure good
#   load balancing when using multiple databases, the PnfsManager
#   supports thread groups. Any database is assigned to one and only
#   one thread group, thus databases assigned to different thread
#   groups are guaranteed not to block each other. Each thread group
#   will have ${pnfsmanager.limits.threads-per-group} threads.
#
#   For best performance isolation, set this to be equal the largest
#   database ID defined in PNFS. When increasing
#   pnfsmanager.limits.thread-groups, you may want to lower
#   pnfsmanager.limits.threads-per-group.
#
#   Notice that PNFS access is still subject to the number of threads
#   created in the PNFS daemon. If this number is lower than the
#   number of concurrent requests, then contention may still occur
#   even though multiple databases are used.
#
pnfsmanager.limits.thread-groups = 1

#  ---- Number of list threads
#
#   The PnfsManager uses dedicated threads for directory list
#   operations. This variable controls the number of threads to
#   use.
#
pnfsmanager.limits.list-threads = 2

#  ---- Max chunk size in list replies
#
#   To avoid out of memory errors when listing large directories,
#   PnfsManager breaks up directory listings in chunk of entries. This
#   setting controls the maximum number of directory entries in a
#   chunk.
#
pnfsmanager.limits.list-chunk-size = 100

#  ---- Threshold for when to log slow requests
#
#   Threshold in milliseconds for when to log slow requests. Requests
#   with a processing time larger than the threshold are logged. Set
#   to 0 to disable. This can also be enabled at runtime using the
#   'set log slow threshold' command.
#
pnfsmanager.limits.log-slow-threshold=0


#  ---- Maximum number of requests in a processing queue
#
#   PnfsManager maintains a request queue per processing thread. This
#   setting specifies the queue length at which point new requests
#   will be denied rather than enqueued for processing. Set to 0 for
#   unlimitted queues.
#
pnfsmanager.limits.queue-length = 0

#  ---- PnfsManager message folding
#
#   Whether to use message folding in PnfsManager. When message folding
#   is enabled, the PnfsManager will try to fold or collapse processing of
#   identical messages. This can reduce the load on PNFS or Chimera if a
#   large number of simultaneous requests on the same objects are performed.
#
(one-of?true|false)pnfsmanager.enable.folding = true

#  ---- Inherit file ownership when creating files and directories
#
#   By default new files and directories receive will be owned by the
#   person who created the files and directories. The owner field will
#   be the UID of the creator and the group field will be the primary
#   GID of the creator.
#
#   If this flag is set to true, then both the owner and the group
#   field will inherit the values from the parent directory.
#
#   In either case, a door may override the values with values
#   provided by the user.
#
(one-of?true|false)pnfsmanager.enable.inherit-file-ownership = false

#  ---- Whether to verify lookup permissions for the entire path
#
#   For performance reasons dCache with PNFS only verified the lookup
#   permissions of the directory containing the file system entry
#   corresponding to the path. Ie only the lookup permissions for the
#   last parent directory of the path were enforced. For compatibility
#   reasons Chimera inherited these semantics.
#
#   When this option is set to true, Chimera will verify the lookup
#   permissions of all directories of a path.
#
(one-of?true|false)pnfsmanager.enable.full-path-permission-check = true

#  ---- Enabled ACL support
#
#   Set to true to enable ACL support.
#
(one-of?true|false)pnfsmanager.enable.acl = false

#  ---- Whether to expect a space manager
(one-of?true|false|${dcache.enable.space-reservation})pnfsmanager.enable.space-reservation = ${dcache.enable.space-reservation}

# Comma separated list of cell addresses to which to send notifications when a file is flushed.

# Cell address to which to send cache location change notifications
pnfsmanager.destination.cache-notification = CacheLocationTopic

# Cell address of space manager
pnfsmanager.service.spacemanager = ${dcache.service.spacemanager}

#  ---- Default Access Latency and Retention Policy
#
#   These variables affect only newly created files.
#
#   Do not use OUTPUT.
#
(one-of?CUSTODIAL|REPLICA|OUTPUT)pnfsmanager.default-retention-policy = CUSTODIAL

(one-of?ONLINE|NEARLINE)pnfsmanager.default-access-latency = NEARLINE

#  ---- Upload directory
#
pnfsmanager.upload-directory=${dcache.upload-directory}

#  ---- Configuration for database connection pool
#
#  The database connection pool reuses connections between successive
#  database operations.  By reusing connections dCache doesn't suffer
#  the overhead of establishing new database connections for each
#  operation.
#
#  The options here determine how the pnfsmanager behaves as the
#  number of concurrent requests fluctuates.
#

#
#  The maximum number of concurrent database connections.
#
pnfsmanager.db.connections.max = 30

#
#  The minimum number of idle database connections.
#
pnfsmanager.db.connections.idle = 1


#
# Database related settings reserved for internal use.
#

#
#  --- Last Access Time (atime) updates for files
#
#  This integer value controls whether and when dCache updates the last access
#  time of files on reading them.
#
#  Values <  0: atimes are never updated.
#  Values >= 0: The maximum absolute(!) difference (in seconds) between a file's
#               "new" atime and its curently stored one, where the atime is not
#               yet updated.
#               For example, when using a value of "4" and the old atime is (in
#               POSIX time) "1000000000", then atimes up to including
#               "1000000004" (but also down to "999999996") are not written;
#               "1000000005" or later (respectively "999999995" or earlier)
#               would be saved.
#
#  Updating the atimes less often (or not at all) may have performance benefits.
