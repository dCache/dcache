#  ---- Java VM options
#
#  Properties that control the options to the Java VM instances.
#
#  There are two kinds of Java virtual machine instances: short-lived
#  and long-lived.
#
#  The short-lived invocations are expected to run as quickly as
#  possible and generally complete within a few seconds.
#
#  The long-lived invocations are the dCache domains.  These will have
#  the same duration as a dCache domain; i.e., many months or years.
#
#  dCache uses different Java options to hint to the JVM that the
#  different invocations have different expected lifetimes; for
#  example, short-lived invocations should favour startup speed over
#  long-term optimisation.
#
#  The JVM options used are dcache.java.options and
#  dcache.java.options.short-lived, both of which include
#  dcache.java.options.common.  In general, these three properties
#  should not be directly reconfigured, but site customisation should
#  be achieved through other properties.  In particular, additional
#  java command-line arguments may be added by configuring either the
#  dcache.java.options.extra or dcache.java.options.short-lived.extra
#  property (or both).

#  This property allows site-specific extra options that are used only
#  for long-lived JVM instances.

#   Various components can bind to a particular network interface.  The value of

#   The value is the IP address of the interface the component should use; for
#   example, the loop-back interface (commonly 'lo') is '127.0.0.1' for IPv4,
#   '::1' for IPv6.
#
#   The address '0.0.0.0' listens on all interfaces for IPv4
#   connections and '::' listens on all interfaces for IPv6
#   connections (depending on the platform, an IPv4 address may be
#   converted to the equivalent IPv6 address and match '::'). If left blank
#   the service will listen on all interfaces.
#
#   If a hostname is specified, the name is resolved to an address and the service
#   binds to that interface. When publishing this interface to SRM or the info
#   service, this name is used as is. Therefore it is advised to use an FQDN. If
#   an address is specified, reverse lookup to obtain the FQDN is performed.
#
#   In addition to the "normal" FQDN (a DNS A/AAAA record), some hosts
#   have a single alias FQDN (e.g., a CNAME record) that points to the
#   normal FQDN.  If clients are expected to use the alias FQDN then

#   ZooKeeper client properties

#   dCache uses it to discover domains and services, exchange
#   configuration, and to coordinate services.
#
#   Although ZooKeeper can be embedded into dCache as a service, it is
#   strongly recommended that a production setup uses an independent
#   ZooKeeper instance, either a standalone single node instance or a
#   redundant multi-node instance (three or five nodes are recommended for
#   such a setup).
#
#   dCache does not use ZooKeeper internal permission handling / ACLs.
#   Therefore, sites that have a dedicated ZooKeeper instance for
#   dCache may disable ACL support (the 'skipACL' option), which the
#   ZooKeeper documentation claims will yield some performance
#   benefits.
#
#   Each dCache domain will connect to the ZooKeeper cluster; in
#   particular, the same dCache node can run multiple domains, each of
#   which will connect to the ZooKeeper cluster.  ZooKeeper limits the

# ---- Certificate Revocation List usage mode
#
# CAs regularly publish certificate revocation lists (CRLs) containing the serial id of

# from the EMI CANL library used by dCache.
#
#	REQUIRE
#
#	   A CRL for CA which issued a certificate being validated
#	   must be present and valid and the certificate must not be on the list.
#
#	IF_VALID
#
#	   If a CRL for CA which issued a certificate being validated
#	   is present and valid then the certificate must not be listed on the CRL.
#	   If the CRL is present but it is outdated (or anyhow else corrupted) then the validation fails.

# ---- On-line Certificate Status Protocol usage mode
#
# On-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative to CRLs in which
# dCache consults an external service to check the validity of a particular certificate.
#
# This setting controls how dCache makes use of this protocol. The following documentation is copied
# from the EMI CANL library used by dCache.
#
#	REQUIRE
#
#	   Require, for each checked certificate, that at least one valid OCSP responder is defined and
#	   that at least one responder of those defined returns a correct certificate status.
#	   If all OCSP responders return error or unknown status, the last one received is treated as a
#	   critical validation error.
#	   Not suggested, unless it is guaranteed that well configured responder(s) is(are) defined
#	   and can handle all queries without timeouts.
#
#	IF_AVAILABLE
#
#	   Use OCSP for each certificate if a responder is available. OCSP 'unknown' status and
#	   query errors (as timeout) do not cause the validation to fail.
#	   Also a lack of defined responder doesn't cause the validation to fail.
#
#	IGNORE
#
#	   Do not use OCSP.
#
#
# Although OCSP lookups are cached for an hour, the refresh when the cache expires blocks new
# client requests. In case of networks problems such refresh would block connections until the
# TCP connection of the refresh times out.  For this reason the default is IGNORE.

# ---- Flags to disable ciphers
#
#   Comma separated list of flags related to ciphers.  The effect is
#   cumulative, so the order of these flags may matter!
#
#   The following flags are understood:
#
#   DISABLE_EC
#
#   Support for certain Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) ciphers
#   is broken with some versions of OpenJDK 7 on Linux; the problem
#   may also affect some versions of OpenJDK 8.
#
#   The cause is the natively library security-provider (libnss3) only
#   supporting a small subset of the ECDH-backed ciphers while OpenJDK
#   believes all are supported.  If, during the TLS handshake, the
#   client and OpenJDK negotiated an ECDH cipher that libnss3 does not
#   support then the handshake will fail with a
#   CKR_DOMAIN_PARAMS_INVALID message.
#
#   Specifying DISABLE_EC will prevent dCache from selecting any
#   ECDH-backed cipher during the handshake.  In some cases, this
#   could result in a less secure cipher.
#
#   The problem is not due to OpenJDK code-base itself but rather from
#   how it is packaged by various distributions.  Different
#   distributions may have fixed this problem, but with different
#   versions.
#
#   You can check whether your installation of Java is affected by
#   starting dCache without DISABLE_EC and running a command like:
#
#       openssl s_client -connect srm.example.org:8445 -key ~/.globus/userkey.pem \
#           -cert ~/.globus/usercert.pem -cipher ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
#
#   If the output includes:
#
#        SSL-Session:
#           Protocol  : TLSv1.2
#           Cipher    : ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
#
#   then your distribution supports one of the problematic ciphers and
#   DISABLE_EC is not needed.
#
#   If, after the command, dCache logs "SSL handshake with [..]
#   failed: no cipher suites in common" then your distribution has
#   removed support for the problematic ciphers (possibly all ECDH
#   ciphers) and DISABLE_EC is not needed.
#
#   If, after the operation, the domain log includes a
#   "CKR_DOMAIN_PARAMS_INVALID" error then your Java requires the
#   DISABLE_EC.
#
#
#   DISABLE_RC4
#
#   RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher that may be used to
#   secure a TLS or GSI connection.  RC4 has several potential
#   attacks, is widely considered weak and, for certain uses, broken.
#
#   Java 8u51 has made RC4 deprecated: it is only used if no non-RC4
#   is available.
#
#   By specifying DISABLE_RC4, dCache prevents RC4 from being used
#   under any circumstances, as required by RFC 7465.
#
#
#   DISABLE_RFC_7540_BANNED_CIPHERS
#
#   RFC 7540 provides an appendix that lists ciphers are considered
#   weak and that should not be used with HTTP/2.  Selecting this
#   option bans all such ciphers.
#
#   Some clients depend on these weak ciphers.  See
#   ENABLE_WEAK_CIPHERS_FOR_SL7_CLIENTS for details.
#
#
#   ENABLE_WEAK_CIPHERS_FOR_SL7_CLIENTS
#
#   Although selecting DISABLE_RFC_7540_BANNED_CIPHERS secures your
#   dCache installation from clients mistakenly using weak or insecure
#   ciphers, some clients only support weak ciphers.  In particular
#   RHEL-7 / CentOS-7 / ScientificLinux-7 clients only support
#   RFC-7540 banned ciphers.
#
#   As a compromise, selecting this option enables support for a small
#   number of ciphers: those believe to introduce the smallest
#   security risk.
#
#   Note, to ensure this option has the desired effect, it should be
#   included last in the list.

#  --- Anonymous fall-back for failed logins
#
#   The doors that use HTTP (webdav and restful) have a feature where
#   a user that supplies authentication material (X.509,
#   username+password, OpenID-Connect access-token, macaroon, ...) but
#   that material fails to log in the user (unknown user, bad
#   password, expired token) is treated as if the client provided no
#   authentication material; i.e., they are the anonymous user.
#
#   With the following property enabled, any operation where the user
#   fails to log in will succeed if the anonymous user is allowed that
#   operation, otherwise a 401 HTTP status code is returned.
#
#   With this option disabled, any operation where the user fails to
#   log in will always fail with a 401 HTTP status code.
#
(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.authn.anonymous-fallback-on-failed-login = false

#  ---- Whether to overwrite existing files on upload
#
#   The following property affects FTP doors, WebDAV doors and the SRM.
#   For dcap see the dcap.authz.truncate property.  For xrootd, the policy is
#   controlled by the client. Note that setting the property to false
#   will break standards compliance.
#
(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.overwrite = true

#  ---- Whether space reservation should be supported.
#
#   Whether to support space reservations in this dCache instance. This
#   controls whether services expect a spacemanager service to operate. Unless
#   you disable this feature, you must instantiate the spacemanager service by adding it
#   to the layout file on one of the dCache nodes (preferably in the same
#   domain as the poolmanager service).
#
(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.space-reservation=true

#  ---- Upload directory
#
#   Some protocols (currently just SRM) allow a client to upload a file and, once
#   satisfied with the file's contents, make the new or updated file "live" in an
#   atomic operation. Such uploads may be aborted before the final step without
#   there being any noticeable effect for other users.
#
#   To achieve this, dCache will point clients to upload files beneath the
#   dcache.upload-directory directory, which must be owned by root and have
#   permission mask 711.  The directory is created automatically if it does not
#   exist and must be accessible through all doors used for SRM uploading.
#
#   If this property is set to an absolute path, it is interpreted as an absolute
#   path in dCache's name space. If this directory is not exposed by a door, that
#   door cannot be used for upload by SRM. This would happen if a non-default root
#   directory has been defined for a door, or if a non-default root directory
#   has been defined for users.
#
#   There are three ways to resolve this problem:
#
#   - Change dcache.upload-directory to a directory that is within a part of
#     the name space exposed by all doors needed for SRM and for all accounts
#     using SRM. E.g. if
#
#           /pnfs/example.org/data
#
#     is the root of all your doors and all your accounts, then setting
#
#           dcache.upload-directory = /pnfs/example.org/data/upload
#
#     is the best solution. This needs to be done for pnfsmanager and all
#     doors.
#
#     If accounts have individual root directories, then this solution may not
#     be suitable.
#
#   - Add additional FTP doors for the SRM configured with
#
#        ftp.root = /
#
#     or
#
#        ftp.root = ${ftp.authz.upload-directory}
#
#     This will expose the upload directory and SRM will automatically
#     prefer these for uploads. This could be done in the same domain as
#     existing doors using a non-standard TCP port.
#
#   - Defined a relative upload directory. If this property is defined to
#     a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the account's root
#     directory. It will thus appear in the name space exposed by the FTP
#     door. There are two downsides to this:
#
#       * The upload directory may conflict with user files and directories.
#
#       * There will be several upload directories scattered throughout the
#         name space. This may make it more difficult to clean up in case
#         dCache fails to remove temporary upload directories.
#
#   This directory should likely be added to any options that impose further path-
#   based access restrictions on doors, if these options are used, for example:
#   wedav.authz.allowed-paths and xrootd.authz.write-paths
#
dcache.upload-directory=/upload

#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#          Database Configuration
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   The current setup assumes that one or more PostgreSQL servers are
#   used by the various dCache components.  Database user and database
#   password are configurable. The dCache components use several databases,
#   which might be located on separate hosts.
#
#   The most performant configuration is to have the database server
#   running on the same host as the dCache component that will
#   access it.  Therefore, the default value for all the following
#   variables is 'localhost'.  Uncomment and change these variables
#   only if you have a reason to deviate from this scheme.
#
#   For example, one valid deployment would be to put the 'billing'
#   database on different host than the pnfs server database and
#   companion, but keep the httpDomain on the admin host.

#  ---- Whether to manage database schemas automatically
#
#   When true, database schemas will be automatically updated when
#   needed. Not all services support this setting. This settings
#   applies to a complete domain and must not be defined at the
#   service level.

#   instance. This setting defines the host of the RDBMS used.

#   With postgresql, a comma separated list of servers in a postgresql cluster

#  certain parts of dCache namespace.  One of the benefits of
#  macaroons is they support autonomous delegation to third-parties
#  with reduced authorization.
#
#  Macaroons are also light-weight in terms of time for creation and
#  storage requirements: typical creation time is a few milliseconds
#  and they require no storage within dCache.  Therefore, in many

#  security trade-offs, there may be some very specific, limited

#  When sending inotify events to a door, multiple events may be sent
#  in a single message.  Doing so improves the throughput by reducing
#  overhead for sending a single event.  Note that batching only
#  occurs in overload situation.
#
#  Setting this value too small increases the likelihood of events
#  being lost during overload situation.  Setting this value too large
#  results in cell messaging being slow to respond and (in extreme
#  cases) running out of memory.

#       Xrootd: support for verifying signed hashes (by server/door)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  Determines which requests must be preceded by signed hash verification.
#
#  When signed hash verification is enforced, a signed hash of the message
#  contents is sent before the actual message; usually the hash is then encrypted
#  using a secret key established by the protocol between the two parties.
#  Sending and verifying a hash this way protects against man-in-the-middle
#  attacks.
#
#  The higher the security level, the more types of messages require signed
#  hash verification; the most stringent level (pedantic) requires all messages
#  sent after authentication is established to be signed.  The levels
#  are somewhat arbitrary and the mappings to the message types may be found
#  in the XrootD protocol documentation.  Default is verification disabled.
#
#  Possible levels:
#
#       kXR_secNone         = 0 (signed hash verification disabled)
#       kXR_secCompatible   = 1;
#       kXR_secStandard     = 2;
#       kXR_secIntense      = 3;
#       kXR_secPedantic     = 4;
#
dcache.xrootd.security.level=0

#
#  Force signed hash verification even if the protocol does not support encryption.
#
#  According to XrootD specification, this flag pertains only to authenticated
#  (e.g., gsi or unix) connections.  The standard XrootD servers will not
#  send signed hashes on unauthenticated connections even with this flag set
#  to true.
#
#  Since pools do not currently require gsi, to enforce hash signing (without
#  encryption) on the pool communication, a protocol of some sort must be used;
#  The unix protocol is (for XrootD) something of a placemarker protocol
#  where the username is the only authentication data.  Its only purpose seems
#  to be to distinguish between "authenticated" and "unauthenticated" (i.e.,
#  anonymous) connections.  Unix authentication uses no encryption
#  algorithm.
#
#  If security level is > 0 and this flag is set to true in dCache,
#  dCache also tells the client to use unix authentication.  That ensures that
#  signed hashes will also be sent.  Without this flag, the pool connection
#  remains unauthenticated.
#
#  In the dCache-XrootD universe, it does not make much sense to
#  require a security level > 0 without also setting this flag to true,
#  since the majority of requests sent after the initial authentication to
#  the door are redirected to the pool.
