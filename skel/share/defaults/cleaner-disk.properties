#
#  The cleaner is the component that watches for files being deleted
#  in the namespace. When files are deleted, the cleaner will notify the
#  pools that hold a copy of the deleted files' data and tell the
#  pools to remove that data.  Optionally, the cleaner can instruct
#  HSM-attached pools to remove copies of the file's data stored on
#  tape.
#
#  The cleaner runs periodically, so there may be a delay between a
#  file being deleted in the namespace and the corresponding deletion
#  of that file's data in pools and on tape.
#
#  The cleaner maintains a list of pools that it was unable to
#  contact: pools are either offline or sufficiently overloaded that
#  they couldn't respond in time.  The cleaner will periodically try
#  to delete data on pools in this list but, between such retries,
#  these pools are excluded from cleaner activity.

#  ----- Whether the service is replicable
#
#   Any service in dCache can have several instances as long as these
#   represent separate logical services. Some services can have several
#   instances representing the same logical service, providing some
#   degree of fault tolerance and load balancing. Such services are said
#   to be replicable.
#
#   Instances of a logical service share the same service name, and it is
#   important that the configuration for such instances is synchronized.
#
#   This property indicates if this service is replicable.
#
#   Note: it is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that all
#   cleaner service instances:
#
#       o  share the same database.
#
(immutable)cleaner-disk.cell.replicable = true

#  ---- Named queues to consume from
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other services can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.

#  ---- Cleaner thread count
#
#  The number of threads in the cleaner's thread-pool.  This
#  thread-pool is used for all cleaner activity.
#  This number also limits the maximum number of pools cleaned in parallel.

#  ---- Pool communication time-out
#
#  The time that the cleaner will wait after sending a message to

#  then the cleaner places this pool in the offline pools list.

#  ---- Maximum files in one message
#
#  For each pool, the cleaner produces a list of all deleted files
#  that have data stored on that pool.  When instructing a pool to
#  remove data, the cleaner includes as many files as possible in the
#  message.
#
#  The cleaner.limits.batch-size property places an upper limit on the
#  number of files' data to be deleted in a message.  If more than
#  this number of files are to be deleted then the pool will receive
#  multiple messages.
#

#
