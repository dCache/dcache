#
# Whenever a client submits an SRM request a thread is allocated. This

#
# Notice that this does not control the number of SRM transfers that
# can be active at any given time: An SRM transfer involves several
# requests by the client (eg srmPrepareToGet, srmStatusOfGetRequest,
# srmReleaseFiles).
#
# There is also a choice whether to process requests synchronously or
# asynchronously. If processed synchronously, the request is not answered
# until processed. This means that a thread is bound to the request for
# the duration of the request processing. If processed asynchronous,
# the thread is released right away and the client submits new requests
# to poll for the completion of the previously submitted request. This
# adds latency and increases authentication overhead, but frees thread
# and TCP connections. See srm.request.switch-to-async-mode-delay.

# ---- Enable legacy socket closure
#
# GSI is layered on top of the SSL/TLS protocol. SSL/TLS specifies that
# if the server wants to close the connection, it is to send an SSL
# close notification to the client. Some clients consider this notification
# a fatal error and expect the server to instead abruptly close the socket.
#
# Setting this property to true causes the server to close the socket without
# sending a close notification first. This should be enabled if compatibility
# with these clients is required.
#
(one-of?true|false)srm.enable.legacy-close=true

# ---- Parameters for schedulable SRM requests
#
# The SRM specification allows some request types to be processed
# asynchronously. Rather than waiting for request processing to
# complete before getting a reply, the client receives a preliminary
# reply stating that the request is accepted with instructions to
# ask back for the result later. The SRM specification allows this
# mode of operation for the following requests:
#
#  o srmReserveSpace
#  o srmUpdateSpace
#  o srmChangeSpaceForFiles
#  o srmLs
#  o srmPrepareToGet
#  o srmPrepareToPut
#  o srmCopy
#  o srmBringOnline
#
# Except for srmUpdateSpace and srmChangeSpaceForFiles, dCache supports
# asynchronous processing for all these requests.
#
# These requests share a common lifecycle:
#
#  o SRM_REQUEST_QUEUED
#
#    The request is queued for processing. dCache is currently not processing
#    the request.
#
#  o SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS
#
#    dCache is processing the request.
#
#  o SRM_FILE_PINNED / SRM_SPACE_AVAILABLE
#
#    For srmPrepareToGet and srmPrepareToPut these states indicate
#    that a transfer URL has been prepared and the client is expected
#    to transfer the file.
#
#  o SRM_SUCCESS / SRM_FAILURE / SRM_RELEASED / SRM_ABORTED
#
#    Request has completed and is no longer active
#
# This lifecycle is controlled by the SRM request scheduler. A separate
# scheduler exists for each request type, allowing limits to be configured
# individually.
#
# The SRM specification supports bulk operations for the following requests:
#
#  o srmLs
#  o srmPrepareToGet
#  o srmPrepareToPut
#  o srmCopy
#  o srmBringOnline
#  o srmRm
#
# A single client request may apply to a large number of files. Internally,
# dCache treats each file in a schedulable bulk request individually. To be
# precise, the scheduling described above does not apply to the entire SRM
# request, but to each site URL in the request. This is also true for the
# configuration properties described below.
#
# srmRm isn't a schedulable request and thus the discussion above doesn't
# apply to it.


# ---- Maximum number of requests allowed
#
# This is the maximum number requests allowed of any given
# request type. Once the limit is reached, new requests will fail
# immediately rather than being queued.
#
# Any request that is not finished counts towards this limit. That is, all
# requests in one of the following states: SRM_REQUEST_QUEUED,
# SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS, SRM_FILE_PINNED and SRM_SPACE_AVAILABLE.
#

# ---- Maximum number of requests in progress
#
# Maximum number of requests to process concurrently of any given request type.
# This limits the number of SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS requests. Once the limit is
# reached, new requests will queue. Requests for which a TURL was already
# computed do not count towards this limit even if their state may be reported
# as SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS.
#
# The setting is a good measure of how much load the SRM can induce directly
# on other services in dCache, such as pnfs manager and pin manager.
#
# Notably, this setting limits the number of files that can be brought online
# simultaneously for get and bring-online requests, and the number of concurrent
# srmCopy transfers.
#
# The setting does NOT limit the number of concurrent upload and downloads. In
# SRM, srmPrepareToPut and srmPrepareToGet do not actually transfer a file: They
# prepare a transfer URL so that the client can transfer a file. Once the transfer
# URL has been prepared, the requests are no longer considered in progress (see
# srm.request.max-transfers).

# ---- Number of simultaneous transfer URLs
#
# This limits the number of TURLs to hand out to clients. If this limit is reached,
# additional requests will be queued after having been prepared.
#
# Note that clients may not actually transfer the file right after receiving a
# TURL. Many advanced clients check out TURLs ahead of time and queue transfers
# to and from those TURLs. Thus the actual number of transfers observed on dCache
# doors may be lower than the number TURLs handed out to the client.
#
# Note that this setting does not apply to srmCopy requests. Such requests do
# not have a TURL as the transfer is done by dCache and not by the client. To
# control the number of concurrent copies use srm.request.copy.max-inprogress or
# the settings of the transfermanagers service.

# ---- Request discriminator
#
# A discriminator identifies a request as coming from a particular user or group of
# users: a party.  Requests with the same discriminator value come from the same party.
#
# Discriminators are typically used by fair-share schedulers when deciding which requests
# should be grouped together.  Such schedulers maintain some degree of fairness between
# requests from different parties (requests with distinct discriminator values) and not
# between requests from the same party.
#
# Discriminators are provided by plugins implementing the JobDiscriminator SPI.  Several
# such plugins ship with dCache:
#
#   uid    The request submitter's UID.
#
#   gid    The request submitter's primary GID.
#
#   dn     The request submitter's distinguished name.
#
#   fqan   The request submitter's primary FQAN.
#
#   user   The request submitter's mapped user name.
#
#   vo     The request submitter's VO association as extracted from the primary FQAN.
#
srm.plugins.discriminator=dn


# ---- Request scheduling strategy
#
# Strategy for how to schedule schedulable SRM requests. The strategy controls in which order
# SRM requests transition from the SRM_REQUEST_QUEUED state to SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS. Once
# the max-inprogress limit for a specific type of requests is reached, subsequent requests are
# queued and the scheduling strategy controls the order in which these requests are processed.
#
# The strategy is pluggable and third party plugins can add new strategies by implementing
# scheduling strategy SPI. Several plugins ship with dCache:
#
#   fifo    First in, first out. Requests are processed in arrival order. Individual users
#           may monopolise the SRM through issuing many requests or issuing long-lasting
#           requests.
#
#   lifo    Last in, first out. The last request to arrive is processed first. In contrast to
#           fifo, this policy is not fair. Under load spikes, some requests will observe longer
#           response times, while others appear fast.
#
#           Lifo does however tend to be more robust in overload scenarios because it processes
#           the requests for which the client is least likely to time out first. In other words,
#           it can maintain maximum request rate, while fifo in some scenarios can enter a
#           live-lock in which all resources are spent on processing requests for which the
#           client subsequently times out.
#
#   throughput-fair-share
#
#           Round robin scheduler providing fair sharing of the request rate. E.g. if two
#           parties have requests queued, requests are scheduled in alternating order. Does
#           not prevent that one party may monopolise the system by submitting long running
#           requests while the other party submits requests that finish quickly.
#
#           A configurable discriminator defines the grouping between which to provide a
#           fair share.
#
#   inprogress-fair-share
#
#           Least-inprogress-requests-first scheduler providing fair sharing of the inprogress
#           slots. E.g. if two parties have requests queued, the party with the least inprogress
#           requests is the one whose request will be started. If one party submits long running
#           requests, that party will effectively be penalized by having a lower request rate.
#
#           A configurable discriminator defines the grouping between which to provide a
#           fair share.

# ---- Request transfer strategy
#
# srmPrepareToPut and srmPrepareToGet requests enter the READY state when the TURL is handed
# out to the client. If the request is processed asynchronously (client is polling for the result),
# the request stays in the RQUEUED state until the client queries the result.
#
# A transfer strategy plugin has the ability to prevent the transition from the RQUEUED to READY
# state. A plugin may allow the number of concurrent transfers to be limited, or may provide
# some fair-share between parties.
#
# Two plugins ship with dCache:
#
#     first-come-first-served
#
#         The maximum number of requests in the READY state is limited by
#         srm.request.*.max-transfers, but otherwise TURLs are handed out to
#         whomever comes first.
#
#     fair-share
#
#         The maximum number of requests in the READY state is limited by
#         srm.request.*.max-transfers, but slots are kept free such that each party with
#         requests in RQUEUED will receive its fair share.
#
#           A configurable discriminator defines the grouping between which to provide a
#           fair share.
#
srm.plugins.transfer = fair-share

# ---- Delay until requests are processed asynchronously
#
# Schedulable SRM requests may be processed synchronously or asynchronously, at
# the server's discretion.  dCache can start to process such requests synchronously
# and, if this is taking too long, reply asynchronously and continue to work on the
# operation background. While in synchronous mode, a webserver thread is blocked
# waiting for the result (see srm.limits.jetty.threads.min and
# srm.limits.jetty.threads.max).
#
# This setting specifies the time after which requests are handled asynchronously.
# Set to 'infinity' to disable asynchronous processing.
#
# Asynchronous processing avoids holding TCP connections to the server while
# the request is processed, but at the expense of the client periodically polling
# the status, thus increasing the perceived request processing time.

#      Differentiated Services-based LAN QoS and WAN MPLS technologies
#      in data-intensive distributed computing environments, such as
#      the RHIC/ATLAS computing environment.
#
#      For more details see https://www.racf.bnl.gov/terapaths

#
#  Lambda Station:
#
#      The Lambda Station project is aimed to enable dynamic
#      allocation of alternate network paths for traffic of production
#      SciDAC applications and to forward designated flows across LAN,
#      negotiates with reservation and provisioning systems of WAN

#
# ---- Third-party transfers
#
#  Third-party copying is when a client requests that data is sent
#  between this dCache cluster and some other storage system without
#  that client acting as an intermediate for the flow of data.
#
#  With a third-party copy initiatied through the SRM protocol, the
#  client may either specify a protocol-specific endpoint (e.g.,
#  'https://storage.example.org/path/to/remote-file'), or an SRM
#  endpoint (e.g., 'srm://storage.example.org/path/to/remote-file').
#  If an SRM endpoint is specified then dCache will negotiate with the
#  remote server to find the best available transfer protocol.
#
#  dCache will try to verify the integrity of transferred data by
#  comparing locally generated checksum values with that obtained from
#  the remote server.  If the transfer did not use the SRM protocol
#  then checksums can only be obtained via the transfer protocol.
#
#  If the transfer protocol is HTTP then RFC 3230 allows dCache to
#  discover checksums for the remote file.  With this, dCache can
#  learn if the file was corrupted during transfer.  If the remote
#  server supports RFC 3230 and the remote server uses a compatible
#  checksum algorithm then dCache will always verify the data
#  integrity.
#
#  Although dCache supports RFC 3230, most HTTP and WebDAV servers
#  currently do not.  It is also possible that, although the remote
#  server supports RFC 3230, the supplied checksum cannot be used by
#  dCache.  When transferring data with such a server, dCache can
#  either transfer the file's data without checksum verification or
#  fail the request.
#
#  The SRM protocol allows the client to steer the transfer by setting
#  ExtraInfo options.  dCache accepts the 'verify' ExtraInfo option
#  with a value of 'true' or 'false'.  If 'true' then checksum
#  verification is required for the transfers and the failure to
#  obtain a suitable checksum will fail the transfer.  If 'false' then
#  dCache will still attempt to verify data integrety but the transfer
#  will not fail because of dCache was unable to verify the data
#  integrety by checking a checksum.  See SRM client documentation for
#  details on how to set ExtraInfo options.
#
#  If the client leaves this option unspecified then the following
#  property's value is used as a default.
#
(one-of?true|false)srm.enable.third-party.requiring-verification-by-default = true

#
#  SRM ping ExtraInfo
#
#  The SRM 'ping' command allows the client to check that the server
#  is alive.  In addition to demonstrating the basic health of the
#  server, the response contains information as a list of key-value
#  pairs.
#
#  Sites can provide additional information by configuring properties
#  with a name that starts 'srm.ping-extra-info!'.  The ExtraInfo key
#  is the property name without this prefix and the ExtraInfo value is
#  the property's value.
#

#
#  Maximum client-assumed average bandwidth
#
#  Certain SRM requests have a lifetime; in particular, for GET, PUT
#  and COPY requests the request lifetime describes for how long files
#  may be transferred.  Given the number of bytes to be transferred,
#  the client is assuming some minimum average bandwidth by specifying
#  a request lifetime.  If the actual average bandwidth is lower than
#  this client-assumed bandwidth then the request will expire during
#  the tranfer.
#
#  dCache does nothing if the lifetime expires during a download (GET)
#  request; however, elapsed lifetimes will result in failed upload
#  requests (PUT) and third-party transfer (COPY) requests.
#
#  Some broken clients have hard-coded, short lifetimes for their
#  requests (e.g., five minutes).  As a consequence, they experience
#  (often sporadic) failures depending on the size of the file(s)
#  involved, the network conditions, and how much IO load the pool is
#  suffering.  This makes such problems difficult to diagnose and the
#  overall service unreliable.
#
#  As a work-around, dCache may be configured to assume some
#  (conservative) estimate of the average bandwidth.  It checks the
#  client-assumed average bandwidth is reasonable; if it is too high
#  (request lifetime is too short) then it increases the request
#  lifetime.  This gives the transfer a reasonable chance of
#  succeeding.
#
#  To enable this work-around, set the configuration property to a
