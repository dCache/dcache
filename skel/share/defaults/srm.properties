#
# A host part of the source url (surl) is used to determine if the
# surl references file in this storage system.  In case of the copy
# operation, srm needs to be able to dinstinguish between the local
# surl and the remote one.  Also srm needs to refuse to perform
# operations on non local srm urls. localSrmHosts is a comma separated
# list of hosts that will be considered local by this srm service.
# This parameter might need to be defined as a list because in case of
# the multihomed or distributed server it may have more than one
# network name.  If localSrmHosts is not specified, srmHost will be

#
# Whenever a client submits an SRM request a thread is allocated. This
# setting controls the maximum number of such threads.
#
# Notice that this does not control the number of SRM transfers that
# can be active at any given time: An SRM transfer involves several
# requests by the client (eg srmPrepareToGet, srmStatusOfGetRequest,
# srmReleaseFiles).
#
# There is also a choice whether to process requests synchronously or
# asynchronously. If processed synchronously, the request is not answered
# until processed. This means that a thread is bound to the request for
# the duration of the request processing. If processed asynchronous,
# the thread is released right away and the client submits new requests
# to poll for the completion of the previously submitted request. This
# adds latency and increases authentication overhead, but frees thread
# and TCP connections. See srm.request.switch-to-async-mode-delay.

# ---- Maximum number of queued SRM requests
#
# Once the limit is reached no new connections will be accepted;
# instead, the operating system will queue them in the TCP backlog.
# Once the TCP backlog is filled, the operating system will reject
# further TCP connections.
#
(deprecated)srmJettyThreadsMaxQueued=500
srm.limits.jetty.threads.queued.max=${srmJettyThreadsMaxQueued}


# ---- Parameters for schedulable SRM requests
#
# The SRM specification allows some request types to be processed
# asynchronously. Rather than waiting for request processing to
# complete before getting a reply, the client receives a preliminary
# reply stating that the request is accepted with instructions to
# ask back for the result later. The SRM specification allows this
# mode of operation for the following requests:
#
#  o srmReserveSpace
#  o srmUpdateSpace
#  o srmChangeSpaceForFiles
#  o srmLs
#  o srmPrepareToGet
#  o srmPrepareToPut
#  o srmCopy
#  o srmBringOnline
#
# Except for srmUpdateSpace and srmChangeSpaceForFiles, dCache supports
# asynchronous processing for all these requests.
#
# These requests share a common lifecycle:
#
#  o SRM_REQUEST_QUEUED
#
#    The request is queued for processing. dCache is currently not processing
#    the request.
#
#  o SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS
#
#    dCache is processing the request.
#
#  o SRM_FILE_PINNED / SRM_SPACE_AVAILABLE
#
#    For srmPrepareToGet and srmPrepareToPut these states indicate
#    that a transfer URL has been prepared and the client is expected
#    to transfer the file.
#
#  o SRM_SUCCESS / SRM_FAILURE / SRM_RELEASED / SRM_ABORTED
#
#    Request has completed and is no longer active
#
# This lifecycle is controlled by the SRM request scheduler. A separate
# scheduler exists for each request type, allowing limits to be configured
# individually.
#
# The SRM specification supports bulk operations for the following requests:
#
#  o srmLs
#  o srmPrepareToGet
#  o srmPrepareToPut
#  o srmCopy
#  o srmBringOnline
#  o srmRm
#
# A single client request may apply to a large number of files. Internally,
# dCache treats each file in a schedulable bulk request individually. To be
# precise, the scheduling described above does not apply to the entire SRM
# request, but to each site URL in the request. This is also true for the
# configuration properties described below.
#
# srmRm isn't a schedulable request and thus the discussion above doesn't
# apply to it.


# ---- Number of threads executing schedulable SRM requests
#
# Thread pool size for processing schedulable SRM requests. Most processing
# is done asynchronously and a low number of threads suffices to serve even
# thousands of concurrent requests. The notable exception are srmCopy and srmLs
# requests; these should be served by a thread pool equal to the number of
# inprogress requests allowed.
#
# This setting should not be confused with srm.limits.jetty.threads.min and
# srm.limits.jetty.threads.max. Those settings control the number of threads
# used by the embedded webserver; those threads are used for all client requests,
# schedulable and unschedulable requests alike, even status queries. Schedulable
# requests are however quickly handed over to the request scheduler and the
# web server thread is released (see srm.request.switch-to-async-mode-delay).
# Another difference is that for bulk requests, the webserver thread is bound
# to the entire request, while the scheduler threads process individual SURLs.

# immediately rather than being queued.

# ---- Maximum number of requests in progress
#
# Maximum number of requests to process concurrently of any given request type.
# This limits the number of SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS requests. Once the limit is

# computed do not count towards this limit even if their state may be reported
# as SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS.
#
# The setting is a good measure of how much load the SRM can induce directly
# on other services in dCache, such as pnfs manager and pin manager.
#
# Notably, this setting limits the number of files that can be brought online
# simultaneously for get and bring-online requests, and the number of concurrent
# srmCopy transfers.
#
# The setting does NOT limit the number of concurrent upload and downloads. In
# SRM, srmPrepareToPut and srmPrepareToGet do not actually transfer a file: They
# prepare a transfer URL so that the client can transfer a file. Once the transfer
# URL has been prepared, the requests are no longer considered in progress (see
# srm.request.max-transfers).

# ---- Number of simultaneous transfer URLs
#
# This limits the number of TURLs to hand out to clients. If this limit is reached,
# additional requests will be queued after having been prepared.
#
# Note that clients may not actually transfer the file right after receiving a
# TURL. Many advanced clients check out TURLs ahead of time and queue transfers
# to and from those TURLs. Thus the actual number of transfers observed on dCache
# doors may be lower than the number TURLs handed out to the client.
#
# Note that this setting does not apply to srmCopy requests. Such requests do
# not have a TURL as the transfer is done by dCache and not by the client. To
# control the number of concurrent copies use srm.request.copy.max-inprogress or
# the settings of the transfermanagers service.

# particular read request, strict protocol compliance requires pinning
# even for disk only files.
#
# Often strict protocol compliance is however unnecessary, or disk
# files may be known to always be on read pools. In those cases one
# can skip the pinning step and thus reduce the latency of
# srmPrepareToGet request.
#
# When this property is set to false, files with access latency of
# ONLINE will not be pinned. If all files in the system have access
# latency of ONLINE, then the SRM will not use the pin manager at
# all. Note that when this property is set to false, orphaned file
# location entries in the name space will not validated during the
# srmPrepareToGet processing. The consequence is that the
# srmPrepareToGet may succeed for a lost and the subsequence file
# transfer will fail.
