#    Default values for srm
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This Java properties file contains default values for srm
# configuration parameters. All values can be redefined in
# etc/dcache.conf. Do not modify any values here as your changes will
# be lost when you next upgrade.

# ---- Cell names
#
srm/cell.name=SRM-${host.name}
transfermanagers/cell.name=RemoteTransferManager

#  ---- TCP Port
#
#  The port SRM will listen on for GSI-based communication.  GSI is an
#  encrypted transport commonly used in grid communication.  It is
#  similar to SSL but incompatible.
#
srmPort=8443
srm/port=${srmPort}
#
#  The port SRM will listen on for SSL-based communication.  SSL is an
#  industry standard encryption transport.
#
srm.ssl.port=8445

#  The interface SRM will listen on.
srm.net.listen=${dcache.net.listen}


# ---- Host name of srm service
#
# For certain operations srm needs to know its domain name.  The
# property "srmHost" can be used to override the default value.  If
# this value is not set, the value is detected automatically and it is
# equivalent to the output of the unix hostname program.
#
srmHost=${host.fqdn}


# ---- Host names of srm services in this deployment
#
# A host part of the source url (surl) is used to determine if the
# surl references file in this storage system.  In case of the copy
# operation, srm needs to be able to dinstinguish between the local
# surl and the remote one.  Also srm needs to refuse to perform
# operations on non local srm urls. localSrmHosts is a comma separated
# list of hosts that will be considered local by this srm service.
# This parameter might need to be defined as a list because in case of
# the multihomed or distributed server it may have more than one
# network name.  If localSrmHosts is not specified, srmHost will be
# used
#
localSrmHosts=${srmHost}


# ---- Client side transport layer encryption
#
# The security transport to use when contacting remote SRM instances.  GSI
# (Grid Security Infrastructure) is the commonly deployed protocol, but SSL
# is the industrial standard.  This property is only used for third-party
# copies (srmCopy).

# ---- Maximum number of threads used for SRM request processing
#
# Whenever a client submits an SRM request a thread is allocated. This
# setting controls the maximum number of such threads.
#
# Notice that this does not control the number of SRM transfers that
# can be active at any given time: An SRM transfer involves several
# requests by the client (eg srmPrepareToGet, srmStatusOfGetRequest,
# srmReleaseFiles).
#
# There is also a choice whether to process requests synchronously or
# asynchronously. If processed synchronously, the request is not
# answered until processed. This means that a thread is bound to the
# request for the duration of the request processing. If prcessed
# asynchronous, the thread is released right away and the client
# submits new requests to poll for the completion of the previously
# submitted request. This adds latency and increases authentication
# overhead, but frees thread and TCP connections.
#
srmJettyThreadsMax=500

# ---- Minimum number of threads used for SRM request processing
srmJettyThreadsMin=10

# ---- Milliseconds before an idle requst processing thread is terminated
srmJettyThreadsMaxIdleTime=30000

# ---- Maximum number of queued SRM requests
#
# Once the limit is reached no new connections will be accepted;
# instead, the operating system will queue them in the TCP backlog.
# Once the TCP backlog is filled, the operating system will reject
# further TCP connections.

# ----- Whether to pin disk files
#
# The SRM protocol allows files to be pinned. The pin suppresses
# automatic garbage collection for the lifetime of the pin.
#
# Since dCache pools may be configured to only serve particular types
# of requests and not every pool may be configured to serve a
# particular read request, strict protocol compliance requires pinning
# even for disk only files.
#
# Often strict protocol compliance is however unnecessary, or disk
# files may be known to always be on read pools. In those cases one
# can skip the pinning step and thus reduce the latency of
# srmPrepareToGet request.
#
# When this property is set to false, files with access latency of
# ONLINE will not be pinned. If all files in the system have access
# latency of ONLINE, then the SRM will not use the pin manager at
# all. Note that when this property is set to false, orphaned file
# location entries in the name space will not validated during the
# srmPrepareToGet processing. The consequence is that the
# srmPrepareToGet may succeed for a lost and the subsequence file
# transfer will fail.
