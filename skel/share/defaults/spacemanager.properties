@DEFAULTS_HEADER@

#  ---- Name of the service
#
#   This is the logical name of the service. The service name is usually
#   the name other service use to reach this service.
#
spacemanager.cell.service = ${dcache.queue.spacemanager}

#  ---- Cell name of space manager
#
#   This property defines the cell name of the space manager service.
#
spacemanager.cell.name = ${dcache.queue.spacemanager}

#  ----- Whether the service is replicable
#
#   Any service in dCache can have several instances as long as these
#   represent separate logical services. Some services can have several
#   instances representing the same logical service, providing some
#   degree of fault tolerance and load balancing. Such services are said
#   to be replicable.
#
#   Instances of a logical service share the same service name, and it is
#   important that the configuration for such instances is synchronized.
#
#   This property indicates if this service is replicable.
#
#   Multiple instances must share the same databases.
#
(immutable)spacemanager.cell.replicable = true

#  ---- Named queues to subscribe to
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other service can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.
#
spacemanager.cell.consume = ${spacemanager.cell.service}
spacemanager.cell.subscribe=${spacemanager.pool-monitor.topic}

# ---- Allow uploads to link groups outside of space reservation
#
#   If set to false, uploads using links in a link group are only possible by
#   creating a space reservation and either bind the space token to a directory
#   through the writeToken tag, or to explicitly upload to that space reservation
#   with SRM. Other uploads will be served with links not in any link group.
#
#   If set to true, uploads that are not bound to any particular space
#   reservation can still be served by links in a link group if the
#   user is authorized to reserve space in the link group.
#
(one-of?true|false)spacemanager.enable.unreserved-uploads-to-linkgroups = false

# ---- Location of LinkGroupAuthorizationFile
#
#   The LinkGroupAuthorizationFileName file contains the list of VOMS
#   FQANs that are allowed to make space reservations within a given
#   link group.

(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)spacemanager.expire-space-reservation.period.unit=MINUTES

# ---- Delay before removing expired or released reservations
#
#   Once a space reservation expires or is released, it has no further influence
#   on space management. It is however kept in the database for awhile to allow
#   the space reservation to be recovered in case it was released by mistake.
#
#   This property controls how long space manager waits after the expiration date
#   before it deletes such reservations permanently. Files in dCache are not
#   deleted by this. Reservations without an expiration date are not automatically
#   deleted. These can be purged manually using the 'purge spaces' command in the
#   space manager admin interface.

# ---- Number of concurrent threads used by space manager
#
# Each thread will likely obtain a connection to the database, meaning the thread limit
# and the database connection limit should be in the same ballpark. It is best to keep
# the connection limit a little higher than the number of threads, as there are a few
# periodic background tasks consuming connections too.
#
spacemanager.limits.threads=20

# ---- Whether space manager is enabled
#
#  If set to false, the spacemanager service will disable itself.
