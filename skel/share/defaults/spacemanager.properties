@DEFAULTS_HEADER@

#  ---- Whether space reservation should be supported.
#
#   Whether to support space reservations in this dCache instance. This
#   controls whether services expect a space manager to operate. You
#   still need to instantiate the spacemanager service by adding it to
#   the layout file on one of the dCache nodes.
#
(forbidden)srmSpaceManagerEnabled = Use dcache.enable.space-reservation
(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.space-reservation=false

#  ---- Cell name of space manager
#
#   This property defines the cell name of the space manager service.
#
spacemanager.cell.name=SrmSpaceManager

#  ---- Whether to export the spacemanager as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the spacemanager cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.
(one-of?true|false)spacemanager.cell.export=true

#  ---- Default access latency
#
#   Default access latency used if space reservation request does not
#   specify one.
#
(forbidden)DefaultAccessLatencyForSpaceReservation = Use spacemanager.default-access-latency
(one-of?ONLINE|NEARLINE)spacemanager.default-access-latency = NEARLINE

(one-of?CUSTODIAL|REPLICA|OUTPUT)spacemanager.default-retention-policy = CUSTODIAL

# ---- Allow uploads to link groups outside of space reservation
#
#   If set to false, uploads using links in a link group are only possible by
#   creating a space reservation and either bind the space token to a directory
#   through the writeToken tag, or to explicitly upload to that space reservation
#   with SRM. Other uploads will be served with links not in any link group.
#
#   If set to true, uploads that are not bound to any particular space
#   reservation can still be served by links in a link group if the
#   user is authorized to reserve space in the link group.
#
(forbidden)SpaceManagerReserveSpaceForNonSRMTransfers = Use spacemanager.enable.unreserved-uploads-to-linkgroups

(one-of?true|false)spacemanager.enable.unreserved-uploads-to-linkgroups = false

# ---- Location of LinkGroupAuthorizationFile
#
#   The LinkGroupAuthorizationFileName file contains the list of VOMS
#   FQANs that are allowed to make space reservations within a given
#   link group.

# ---- Delay before removing expired or released reservations
#
#   Once a space reservation expires or is released, it has no further influence
#   on space management. It is however kept in the database for awhile to allow
#   the space reservation to be recovered in case it was released by mistake.
#
#   This property controls how long space manager waits after the expiration date
#   before it deletes such reservations permanently. Files in dCache are not
#   deleted by this. Reservations without an expiration date are not automatically
#   deleted. These can be purged manually using the 'purge spaces' command in the
#   space manager admin interface.

# Each thread will likely obtain a connection to the database, meaning the thread limit
# and the database connection limit should be in the same ballpark.

# ---- Whether space manager is enabled
#
#  If set to false, the spacemanager service will disable itself.
