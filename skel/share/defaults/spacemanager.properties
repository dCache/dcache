@DEFAULTS_HEADER@

#  ---- Cell name of space manager
#
#   This property defines the cell name of the space manager service.
#
spacemanager.cell.name=SpaceManager

#  ---- Whether to export the spacemanager as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the spacemanager cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.
(one-of?true|false)spacemanager.cell.export=true

# ---- Allow uploads to link groups outside of space reservation
#
#   If set to false, uploads using links in a link group are only possible by
#   creating a space reservation and either bind the space token to a directory
#   through the writeToken tag, or to explicitly upload to that space reservation
#   with SRM. Other uploads will be served with links not in any link group.
#
#   If set to true, uploads that are not bound to any particular space
#   reservation can still be served by links in a link group if the
#   user is authorized to reserve space in the link group.

(one-of?true|false)spacemanager.enable.unreserved-uploads-to-linkgroups = false

# ---- Location of LinkGroupAuthorizationFile
#
#   The LinkGroupAuthorizationFileName file contains the list of VOMS
#   FQANs that are allowed to make space reservations within a given
#   link group.

# ---- Delay before removing expired or released reservations
#
#   Once a space reservation expires or is released, it has no further influence
#   on space management. It is however kept in the database for awhile to allow
#   the space reservation to be recovered in case it was released by mistake.
#
#   This property controls how long space manager waits after the expiration date
#   before it deletes such reservations permanently. Files in dCache are not
#   deleted by this. Reservations without an expiration date are not automatically
#   deleted. These can be purged manually using the 'purge spaces' command in the
#   space manager admin interface.

# ---- Number of concurrent threads used by space manager
#
# Each thread will likely obtain a connection to the database, meaning the thread limit
# and the database connection limit should be in the same ballpark. It is best to keep
# the connection limit a little higher than the number of threads, as there are a few
# periodic background tasks consuming connections too.
#
spacemanager.limits.threads=20

# ---- Whether space manager is enabled
#
#  If set to false, the spacemanager service will disable itself.
