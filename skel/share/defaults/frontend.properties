#   Custom HTTP headers in response
#
#   The following configuration prefix is used to add custom headers

#  ---- Static values for frontend
#
#   The frontend can provide arbitrary information to clients based on
#   dCache configuration.  This is likely most useful for providing
#   static information (such as configuration) to clients that use
#   frontend.
#
#   The data is organised as key-value pairs.  These key-value pairs
#   are serialised into a JSON object.  This JSON object is available
#   to clients making GET requests in two forms: as the simple JSON
#   object itself and in the form of a simple JavaScript fragment that
#   defines the 'CONFIG' variable, depending on which MIME type the
#   client requests.
#
#   A colon-separated list of paths on which the client may request
#   the values.
#
frontend.static.path = /scripts/config.js

#   The information conveyed as a JSON object.  It is recommended that
#   all values intended for the same client have a common prefix.
#
#   The following keys are understood by dCache View:
#
#       dcache-view.endpoints.webapi
#
#           The webapi is offered by this frontend service, so the
#           default value is a relative path pointing back to this
#           server.
#
#           MUST end with a slash.
#
#       dcache-view.endpoints.webdav
#
#           dCacheView uses the webapi for meta data access, but
#           actual file transfers are served from the regular webdav
#           door.
#
#           If left empty, is is assumed the webdav service runs on
#           the same host as the frontend door on port 2880. One could
#           set this to something like https://example.org:443/.
#
#           MUST end with a slash if non-empty.
#
#       dcache-view.org-name
#
#           Name placed at the top of the dCacheView application.
#
#       dcache-view.oidc-provider-name-list
#       dcache-view.oidc-client-id-list
#       dcache-view.oidc-authz-endpoint-list
#
#           Support for OpenID Connect in dCacheView
#
#           After setting up openID connect in the webdav; dcache-view
#           needs to be configured. This will enable user to be able
#           to authenticate with an OpenID connect account.
#
#           These 3 properties below must be set.
#
#           If you have more than one OpenID connect provider, each
#           property takes a space separated value; that is, one for
#           each providers. Therefore, the set values of each
#           properties MUST be in the same order, since these will be
#           mapped together.
#
#           Example: Say you have enable two OpenID connect providers;
#           namely: openid1 and openid2. The 3 properties will be
#           setup as follow:
#
#           frontend.static!dcache-view.oidc-provider-name-list = openid1 openid2
#           frontend.static!dcache-view.oidc-client-id-list = clientID1 clientID2
#           frontend.static!dcache-view.oidc-authz-endpoint-list = \
#               https://oidc.example.com/authz \
#               https://auth.example.org/authorize

#  ---- Root path

#  ---- Event support
#
# dCache supports delivering events: asynchronous notification for
# clients that something of interest has happened.  This is based on
# the Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol.
#
# Events are delivered to clients via a channel, with each channel
# having a unique SSE endpoint.  A client should need only a single
# channel for all events.  Channels are not intended to be shared
# between clients.  Therefore each client needs its own channel.
#
# At any point in time, a client either has or has not established a
# TCP connection to its SSE endpoint.  If a client is disconnected
# from the SSE endpoint for an extended period, the corresponding
# channel is garbage collected automatically.  Channels have a default
# garbage-collection period, but this period may also be adjusted by
# the client.
#
#  ---- Maximum event channels
#
# The maximum number of concurrent channels any dCache user may have.
# Once this limit is reached, subsequent requests for a new channel
# will fail.
#
frontend.limit.events.channels-per-user = 128

#  ---- Garbage-collection policy

# endpoint before the corresponding channel is automatically garbage
# collected.
