#  ---- Cell name of the door
#
frontend.cell.name=Frontend-${host.name}

#  ---- Named queues to subscribe to
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other service can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.

#
#   Specifies the TCP port on which the door accepts connections.
#

#  ---- What IP address to listen on
#
#   Specifies the IP address to which the door listens for
#   connections from clients. Defaults to the wildcard address.
#
frontend.net.listen = ${dcache.net.listen}

#  ---- Whether to use HTTP or HTTPS
#
#   Specifies whether the HTTP or the HTTPS protocol is used. For
#   HTTPS, a server certificate and a trust store need to be
#   created. By default these are stored under /etc/grid-security/.
#
#   The value https-jglobus is deprecated and is an alias for https.

#  ---- Whether client certificates are required for HTTPS
#
#   This parameter specifies whether the door will require a
#   client certificate for authentication.
#
(one-of?true|false)frontend.authn.require-client-cert = false

#  ---- Whether HTTP Basic authentication is enabled
#
#   When enabled a user name and password will be requested on
#   authorization failures.
#
#   Note that HTTP Basic authentication essentially transfers
#   passwords in clear text. A secure setup should only use HTTP Basic
#   authentication over HTTPS.

#
#   Specifies which HTTP methods are granted to anonymous
#   clients. NONE specifies that all anonymous requests will be
#   rejected; READONLY specifies that only read requests are allowed
#   (that is, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and PROPFIND); FULL specifies that
#   all HTTP methods are allowed.

#   Anonymous clients are still subject to authorisation: Only
#   operations with world access are granted.

#
#   When set to true, only read operations are allowed through the frontend.

# ---- Whether to expect the haproxy Proxy Protocol
#
# Many load balancers and reverse proxies support the Proxy Protocol, a
# de facto standard introduced by the haproxy product. Support for this
# protocol has to be enabled in both the load balancer/reverse proxy and
# the backend service.
#
# If enabled, the proxy injects the actual clients IP address into the data
# stream, thus letting the backend be aware of the clients address.
#
# Only version 1 of the proxy protocol is supported.
#
(one-of?true|false)frontend.enable.proxy-protocol = false

# ---- Threads that accept TCP connections
#
# The number of threads that accept and dispatch new client connections.
# Except under very high connection rates, a single thread should be
# sufficient.
#
frontend.limits.acceptors=1

# ---- Time before an idle connection is closed
#
# An idle connection is one on which no data is transferred.
#
# Note that a connection may appear idle because the door is blocked
# on other operations on dCache, such as waiting for a file to stage from
# tape, or waiting for a mover to start. It is advisable that this timeout
# is not lower than the individual timeouts configured for talking to other
# dCache services.

#
# An idle connection is one on which no data is transferred. The door
# is considered under high load when all request processing threads
# are busy.
#
# Under high load, new connections will be configured with this timeout
# rather than the timeout defined by frontend.limits.idle-time. Currently,
# existing connections are not affected, although this may change in
# the future.

# threads cannot keep up, up to this number of connections are queued
# before new connections are rejected.

# ---- Maximum number of threads used for request processing
#
# Whenever a client submits a request, the request is processed by a thread.
# This setting controls the maximum number of such threads.
#
frontend.limits.threads.max=500

# ---- Minimum number of threads used for request processing
#
# Request processing threads that have been idle for a while are terminated.
# This setting controls a minimum number of threads to keep alive even
# when idle.

# ---- Maximum number of queued requests
#
# Once the limit is reached no new connections will be accepted;
# instead, the operating system will queue them in the TCP backlog.
# Once the TCP backlog is filled, the operating system will reject
# further TCP connections.
#
frontend.limits.queue-length=500

# ---- Shutdown timeout
#
# During shutdown no new connections will be accepted. Existing
# connections will be given this much time to complete the
# request, after which the connections are forcefully broken.

#   Custom HTTP headers in response
#
#   The following configuration prefix is used to add custom headers
#   to dCache responses.  The key part (after the prefix) is used as
#   the header; the value is the header's value.  For example, specifying
#
#       frontend.custom-response-header!Foo = bar
#
#   ensures that HTTP responses will include the line:
#
#       Foo: bar
#
#   The pool.mover.http.custom-response-header property has a similar
#   effect for pools.

#  ---- HTTP endpoint of dCache webdav service
#
#   dCacheView uses the webapi for meta data access, but actual
#   file transfers are served from the regular webdav door.
#
#   If left empty, is is assumed the webdav service runs on the same
#   host as the frontend door on port 2880. One could set this
#   to something like https://example.org:443/.
#
#   MUST end with a slash if non-empty.
