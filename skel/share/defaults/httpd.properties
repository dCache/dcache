# ---- Whether to expect the haproxy Proxy Protocol
#
# Many load balancers and reverse proxies support the Proxy Protocol, a
# de facto standard introduced by the haproxy product. Support for this
# protocol has to be enabled in both the load balancer/reverse proxy and
# the backend service.
#
# If enabled, the proxy injects the actual clients IP address into the data
# stream, thus letting the backend be aware of the clients address.
#
# Only version 1 of the proxy protocol is supported.
#
(one-of?true|false)httpd.enable.proxy-protocol = false

# ----- Whether to process X-Forwarded-For headers
#
# HTTP reverse proxies typically and HTTP aware load balancers can often
# be configured to inject X-Forwarded-For headers to reveal information
# about the original request the client made to the proxy.
#
# These X-Forwarded-For headers serve a similar role as the proxy protocol
# described above. Being HTTP specific, the header does however reveal
# additional information, such as whether the original connection used
# HTTP or HTTPS. This is particularly important for the Webadmin interface.
#
# In contrast to the proxy protocol setting above, enabling processing of
# the X-Forwarded-For header does not prevent direct access (without a
# proxy), however be aware that this should only be allowed from trusted
# clients; an opponent may mask his or her identity by injecting false
# information through this header.
