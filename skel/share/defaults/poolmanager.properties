#  ----- Whether the service is replicable
#
#   Any service in dCache can have several instances as long as these
#   represent separate logical services. Some services can have several
#   instances representing the same logical service, providing some
#   degree of fault tolerance and load balancing. Such services are said
#   to be replicable.
#
#   Instances of a logical service share the same service name, and it is
#   important that the configuration for such instances is synchronized.
#
#   This property indicates if this service is replicable.
#
#   Note: it is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that all
#   poolmanager service instances have consistent dCache
#   'poolmanager.'  configuration.
#
(immutable)poolmanager.cell.replicable = true

#  ---- Named queues to consume from
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other services can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.

#  ---- ZooKeeper setup node for PoolManager
#
#   If non-null, the pool manager setup is continuously synced with this node in
#   ZooKeeper. Any local changes are propagated to ZooKeeper and any changes in
#   ZooKeeper are applied locally. The pool manager configuration will be persistent
#   across pool manager restarts even when the 'save' command is not used. To reload
#   the setup file one explicitly has to issue the 'reload' command - a service
#   restart will not suffice.
