#   To activate Replica Manager you need make changes in 3 places:
#    1) you need to run the replica service somewhere in your
#       dCache installation by enabling it in a layout file
#    2) configure the service in etc/dcache.conf file on node where
#       the replica service is running
#    3) define Resilient pool group(s) in PoolManager.conf on the host
#       running the poolmanager service

#  ---- Cell name of Replica Manager
#
replica.cell.name=replicaManager

#  ---- Whether to export the replica cell as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the replica cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.
(deprecated,one-of?true|false)replica.cell.export=true

#  ---- Named queues to subscribe to
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other service can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.

#  ---- Message topics to subscribe to
replica.cell.subscribe=PoolStatusTopic,CacheLocationTopic

#  ---- Will Replica Manager be started?
#
#   Whether to expect a replica manager in this dCache instance. This
#   controls whether services expect a replica service to operate. You
#   still need to instantiate the replica service by adding it to the
#   layout file on one of the dCache nodes.

#  ---- Which pool-group will be the group of resilient pools?
#
#   Values:  <pool-Group-Name>, a pool-group name existing in the PoolManager.conf
#
#   Only pools defined in pool group ResilientPools in
#   config/PoolManager.conf will be managed by ReplicaManager. You
#   must edit config/PoolManager.conf to make the replica manager
#   work. To use another pool group defined in PoolManager.conf for
#   replication, please specify group name by changing this setting.
