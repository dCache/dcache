@DEFAULTS_HEADER@

#  ---- Name of the service
#
#   This is the logical name of the service. The service name is usually
#   the name other service use to reach this service.
#
pinmanager.cell.service = ${dcache.queue.pinmanager}

#  ---- Cell name of pin manager service
#
pinmanager.cell.name = ${dcache.queue.pinmanager}

#  ----- Whether the service is replicable
#
#   Any service in dCache can have several instances as long as these
#   represent separate logical services. Some services can have several
#   instances representing the same logical service, providing some
#   degree of fault tolerance and load balancing. Such services are said
#   to be replicable.
#
#   Instances of a logical service share the same service name, and it is
#   important that the configuration for such instances is synchronized.
#
#   This property indicates if this service is replicable.
#
#   Multiple instances must share the same databases.
#
(immutable)pinmanager.cell.replicable = true

#  ---- Named queues to subscribe to
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other service can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.
#
pinmanager.cell.consume = ${pinmanager.cell.service}
pinmanager.cell.subscribe=${pinmanager.pool-monitor.topic}

#  ---- Cell message processing parameters
#
#  Settings for the request processing thread pool.
#
#  The thread pool will stay at the minimum number of threads until the
#  maximum request queue length has been reached. At that point the number
#  of threads is increased up to the maximum, after which further requests
#  will be dropped. Idle threads are terminated after the idle time until
#  the number of threads drops back to the minimum.
#
#  Except for database operations, the pin manager operates in an
#  asynchronous fashion. The minimum number of threads should be chosen
#  such that the database can be saturated under load. If network latency
#  between the pin manager and the database is high, then the minimum
#  number of threads could be increased to hide this latency. The default
#  setting is likely fine for most cases.
#
#  The maximum number of threads should be below the database connection
#  limit - otherwise threads end up blocking for idle connections and may
#  potentially deadlock in case the same thread needs more than one
#  connection (e.g. for nested transactions).
