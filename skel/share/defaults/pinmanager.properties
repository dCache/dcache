#  ---- Cell name of pin manager service
#
pinmanager.cell.name=PinManager

#  ---- Whether to export the pinmanager cell as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the pinmanager cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.
(one-of?true|false)pinmanager.cell.export=true

#  ---- Cell message processing parameters
#
#  Settings for the request processing thread pool.
#
#  The thread pool will stay at the minimum number of threads until the
#  maximum request queue length has been reached. At that point the number
#  of threads is increased up to the maximum, after which further requests
#  will be dropped. Idle threads are terminated after the idle time until
#  the number of threads drops back to the minimum.
#
#  Except for database operations, the pin manager operates in an
#  asynchronous fashion. The minimum number of threads should be chosen
#  such that the database can be saturated under load. If network latency
#  between the pin manager and the database is high, then the minimum
#  number of threads could be increased to hide this latency. The default
#  setting is likely fine for most cases.
#
#  The maximum number of threads should be below the database connection
#  limit - otherwise threads end up blocking for idle connections and may
#  potentially deadlock in case the same thread needs more than one
#  connection (e.g. for nested transactions).
