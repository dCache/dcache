#  ---- Mover queues to create on a pool
#
#   Mover queues schedule and execute transfers on a pool. Each mover
#   queue can have individual limits and timeouts. These are
#   configured at runtime through the admin interface.
#
#   Doors can be configured to submit transfers to named queues.
#
#   This property takes a comma separated list of named mover queues.
#   The default mover queue is called 'regular' and is always created.
#   The 'regular' mover queue must not be defined in this property.
#
#   Named queues with names that begin with a hyphen are processed in
#   LIFO order; all other queues are process in FIFO order.
#
(forbidden)poolIoQueue = Use pool.queues
pool.queues =

#  ---- Large File Store
#
#   Legacy option for disk only pools. There is usually no need to
#   change this setting as the choice whether to write a file to tape
#   is now controlled by the retention policy of each file.

(forbidden)lfs = Use pool.lfs

#  ---- Maximum amount of space to be used by a pool
#
#   In bytes or 'Infinity'. May also be configured at runtime through

#  ---- Pool tags
#
#   White space separated list of key value pairs to associate with a
#   pool.
#
(forbidden)tags = Use pool.tags
pool.tags = hostname=${host.name}

#  ---- Command to execute periodically to check pool health
#
#   If defined and if pool.enable.repository-check is set to true, the
#   command is executed once a minute. The command is usually a script
#   that checks file system, disk array and host health. Any arguments
#   are passed along.
#
#   As the command is executed frequently, it should not perform any
#   expensive checks, nor should the check take longer than at most a
#   few seconds.
#
#   If the exit code is 0, the pool is assumed to be okay. If the exit
#   code is 1, the pool is marked read-only. Any other exit code will
#   disabled the pool.
#
#   Once marked read-only or disabled, the pool will not reenable
#   itself, even if subsequent invocations exit with 0. The pool can
#   manually be reenabled using the 'pool enable' admin shell command.
#
#   stdout and stderr of the command are written to the domain's log
#   file.
#
pool.check-health-command=

#  ---- Whether to monitor pool health
#
#   If true, then the pool periodically performs a number of health
#   checks and disables itself if an error is detected.
#
#   The health check also involves checking the amount of free space
#   in the file system and adjusting the pool size if the amount of
#   free space in the file system is less than the free space of the pool.
#
(forbidden)checkRepository = Use pool.enable.repository-check

pool.cell.name=${pool.name}

#  ---- Whether to export the pool cell as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the pool cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.

#  ---- Do not start the pool until specified paths exists.
#
#   If specified then pool startup procedure will block as long as
#   specified paths does not exists. This is useful to delay pool startup
#   until repository's directory is available.
#
#   Format: [path1][:path2]...[:pathN]
#   For example:

(forbidden)waitForFiles = Use pool.wait-for-files
pool.wait-for-files=

#  ---- Which meta data repository implementation to use.
#
#   This selects which meta data repository implementation to use.
#   This is essentially a choice between storing meta data in a large
#   number of small files in the control/ directory, or to use the
#   embedded Berkeley database stored in the meta/ directory.  Both
#   directories are within the pool directory.

# Whether to enable RPCSEC_GSS for NFS mover
#
(one-of?true|false)pool.mover.nfs.rpcsec_gss = false

#  ---- NFS mover port range
#
# This option controls TCP port range used by NFS mover. In most
# cases we would like to reduce the range to a single port to
# let client to reconnect. If client failed to reconnect to the
# mover, then a RPC request may stay in clients task queue in a
# 'D' state and increase CPU load by one.

#  ----- Whether to use memory mapping in FTP mover
#
#   If true, the FTP mover utilizes memory mapping for checksum
#   verification. This potentially improves performance, but may cause
#   compatibility issues on some platforms.
#
(forbidden)gsiftpAllowMmap = Use pool.mover.ftp.mmap
(one-of?true|false)pool.mover.ftp.mmap = false

#  ----- Distance between transfer and checksum computation in FTP mover
#
#   When the checksum is computed on the fly, the FTP mover performs
#   the checksum calculation in a separate thread. This property
#   indicates the maximum distance in bytes between the transfer and
#   the checksum calculation. If too small then the transfer may be
#   throttled by a slow checksum calculation. If too large then data
#   may have to be read back from disk rather than read from the
#   cache.
#
(forbidden)gsiftpReadAhead = Use pool.mover.ftp.read-ahead

#  ---- Xrootd plugins
#
#   Comma separated list of plugins to inject into the xrootd
#   request processing chain.
#
#   dCache ships with a few plugins:
#
#    authn:gsi  - any xrootd request to the door will use a key-exchange
#                 process to identify the end-user (pool only).
#
#    authz:alice-token - ALICE token based authorization plugin.
#
#    access-log - generates a dCache style access log using the NetLogger
#                 format. Read and write requests are logged at debug
#                 level to avoid generating too many log messages.
#
#   No plugins are required. If an authentication plugin is
#   specified, then note that the subject will *not* be mapped by
#   gPlazma.
#
#   Pools authorize access using a one-time token generated by the door
#   when redirecting the client to the pool. For this reason an
#   authentication or authorization plugin is usually *not* needed
#   on pools.
#
#   Third party plugins can be used by adding the plugin to the plugin
#   directory of dCache and specifying the plugin name here. Authentication
#   and authorization plugins can be loaded as authn:<plugin> and
#   authz:<plugin> respectively.

#   Custom HTTP headers in response
#
#   The following configuration prefix is used to add custom headers
#   to dCache responses.  The key part (after the prefix) is used as
#   the header; the value is the header's value.  For example, specifying
#
#       pool.mover.http.custom-response-header!Foo = bar
#
#   ensures that HTTP responses will include the line:
#
#       Foo: bar
#

#   for the webdav door.
