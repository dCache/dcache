#  ---- Mover queues to create on a pool
#
#   Mover queues schedule and execute transfers on a pool. Each mover
#   queue can have individual limits and timeouts. These are
#   configured at runtime through the admin interface.
#
#   Doors can be configured to submit transfers to named queues.
#
#   This property takes a comma separated list of named mover queues.
#   The default mover queue is called 'regular' and is always created.
#   The 'regular' mover queue must not be defined in this property.
#
#   Named queues with names that begin with a hyphen are processed in
#   FIFO order; all other queues are processed in LIFO order. Although
#   LIFO is unfair, it tends to provide better behaviour in periods of
#   overload. Neither queueing discipline can magically resolve sustained
#   overload.
#
#   This property is deprecated. It is preferred to create movers dynamically
#   through the admin shell 'mover queue create' command.

#  ---- Command to execute periodically to check pool health
#
#   If defined and if pool.enable.repository-check is set to true, the
#   command is executed once a minute. The command is usually a script
#   that checks file system, disk array and host health. Any arguments
#   are passed along.
#
#   As the command is executed frequently, it should not perform any
#   expensive checks, nor should the check take longer than at most a
#   few seconds.
#
#   If the exit code is 0, the pool is assumed to be okay. If the exit
#   code is 1, the pool is marked read-only. Any other exit code will
#   disabled the pool.
#
#   Once marked read-only or disabled, the pool will not reenable
#   itself, even if subsequent invocations exit with 0. The pool can
#   manually be reenabled using the 'pool enable' admin shell command.
#
#   stdout and stderr of the command are written to the domain's log
#   file.

#  ---- Whether to monitor pool health
#
#   If true, then the pool periodically performs a number of health
#   checks and disables itself if an error is detected.

#   in the file system and adjusting the pool size if the amount of
#   free space in the file system is less than the free space of the pool.

#      file, which should be reclaimed whenever the sweeper is triggered
#      because there is not enough free space.
#
#      The default value means the sweeper will try to remove just enough
#      space to accommodate the file.  Setting the value somewhat higher
#      can serve to reduce the number of calls to the sweeper on busy pools

#  ---- NFS mover port range
#
# This option controls TCP port range used by NFS mover. In most
# cases we would like to reduce the range to a single port to
# let client to reconnect. If client failed to reconnect to the
# mover, then a RPC request may stay in clients task queue in a

#  ---- NFS mover's request processing policy ----
#
# When a NFS request received over the network there are two
# possible ways to process it - to use the same thread, which received the
# request, called SAME_THREAD, or to use a pool of worker threads,
# called WORKER_THREAD. WORKER_THREAD typically gives better throughput with
# the risk that more aggressive clients can degrade the performance of less
# aggressive clients.  SAME_THREAD limits the impact of aggressive clients on
# less aggressive clients but also reduces the maximum throughput of any one client.

#  ----- Whether to use memory mapping in FTP mover

#
(one-of?true|false)pool.mover.ftp.mmap = false


#  ----- Whether to log incomplete transfers
#
#   The following property controls whether the FTP mover will log
#   statistics about transfers aborted by the client.  This mover is
#   responsible for direct uploads and downloads, and for third-party
#   transfers initiated with the FTP protocol.
#
#   It is not always possible for the pool to detect incomplete
#   transfers; for example, if the transfer uses mode S and dCache
#   accepts data then the pool cannot know if that transfer is
#   incomplete.  The pool can detect incomplete transfers if dCache is
#   supplying data, or if the transfer uses mode E.
#
#   An incomplete transfer may be due to the pool detecting a problem
#   (e.g., unable to connect to the target TCP port) or from the
#   client detecting some problem (e.g., insufficient progress).
#   Logging the statistics when that transfer is aborted may yield
#   information that helps diagnose such problems.

#  ----- Distance between transfer and checksum computation in FTP mover
#
#   When the checksum is computed on the fly, the FTP mover performs
#   the checksum calculation in a separate thread. This property
#   indicates the maximum distance in bytes between the transfer and
#   the checksum calculation. If too small then the transfer may be
#   throttled by a slow checksum calculation. If too large then data
#   may have to be read back from disk rather than read from the
#   cache.

#  ---- Xrootd plugins
#
#   Comma separated list of plugins to inject into the xrootd
#   request processing chain.
#
#   dCache ships with a few plugins:
#
#    authn:gsi  - any xrootd request to the door will use a key-exchange
#                 process to identify the end-user (pool only).
#
#    authz:alice-token - ALICE token based authorization plugin.
#
#   No plugins are required. If an authentication plugin is
#   specified, then note that the subject will *not* be mapped by
#   gPlazma.
#
#   Pools authorize access using a one-time token generated by the door
#   when redirecting the client to the pool. For this reason an
#   authentication or authorization plugin is usually *not* needed
#   on pools.
#
#   Third party plugins can be used by adding the plugin to the plugin
#   directory of dCache and specifying the plugin name here. Authentication
#   and authorization plugins can be loaded as authn:<plugin> and
#   authz:<plugin> respectively.
#
#   NOTE:  the access-log plugin, which generates a dCache style access log
#          using the NetLogger format, is now added automatically.
#
pool.mover.xrootd.plugins=

#  ---- Xrootd third-party client authentication plugins
#
#   Comma separated list of plugins to inject into the xrootd tpc client
#   request processing chain.
#
#   Currently xrootd servers require an authentication step between them
#   during third-party transfer.  When dCache is the destination, it uses
#   a client to read the data, piping it to a mover which then writes it
#   to the selected pool.  The client needs to authenticate, and this
#   is handled by these plugin implementations, named by protocol.
#
#   No plugins means dCache can be used as third party destination only
#   with xrootd servers that require no authentication.
#
#   dCache ships with:
#
#        gsi   - request to the source server from dcache will
#                use a key-exchange process to identify the end-user.
#
#        unix  - request to the source server from dcache will
#                use unix authentication.
#
#                NOTE: third-party copying between dCache instances or doors
#                requires this plugin on destination pools in addition to
#                any other auth plugins, if hash signing is enforced on
#                the pools (see pool.xrootd.security.force-signing).

#  ---- inotify support
#
#  dCache generates IN_ACCESS or IN_MODIFY events for watched files in

#  Setting pool.inotify-generation.io-suppression to zero disables
