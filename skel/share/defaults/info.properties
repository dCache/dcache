#   This is the logical name of the service. The service name is usually
#   the name other service use to reach this service.

#  ----- Whether the service is replicable
#
#   Any service in dCache can have several instances as long as these
#   represent separate logical services. Some services can have several
#   instances representing the same logical service, providing some
#   degree of fault tolerance and load balancing. Such services are said
#   to be replicable.
#
#   Instances of a logical service share the same service name, and it is
#   important that the configuration for such instances is synchronized.
#
#   This property indicates if this service is replicable.

#  ---- Named queues to subscribe to
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other service can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.
