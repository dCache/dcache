#  ---- Whether to export the xrootd cell as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the xrootd cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.

#  ---- Named queues to subscribe to
#
#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other service can
#   write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#   address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#   This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#   consume from.

#
#   These parameters are set to the absolute paths of directories

#  ---- Xrootd plugins
#
#   Comma separated list of plugins to inject into the xrootd
#   request processing chain.
#
#   dCache ships with a few plugins:
#
#    gplazma:none - no authentication is performed; user identity is
#                   set to ${xrootd.authz.user} (door only).
#
#    gplazma:gsi  - any xrootd request to the door will use a key-exchange
#                   process to identify the end-user (door only).
#
#    authz:alice-token - ALICE token based authorization plugin.
#
#    access-log - generates a dCache style access log using the NetLogger
#                 format.
#
#   A gplazma:* authentication plugin is required; use
#   gplazma:none if no authentication is desired. Authorization plugins
#   have to be placed after the authentication plugin.
#
#   Third party plugins can be used by adding the plugin to the plugin
#   directory of dCache and specifying the plugin name here. Note that
#   third party authentication plugins have to be loaded with
#   gplazma:<plugin>.
#
#   Placement of the access-log is significant, as other plugins may alter
#   the request. To include login events in the access log, the access-log
#   plugin must be placed after the gplazma:* authentication plugin.
#
xrootd.plugins=gplazma:none,access-log,authz:none

#  ---- User identity used for authorizing operations
#
#   As xrootd requests are not authenticated, an identity has to be
#   chosen for authorizing operations. All operations are performed as
#   this identity.
#
#   The authorization controlled by this parameter is different from
#   the authorization performed by the authorization plugin: The
#   authorization plugin validates the requests themselves
#   independently of the file which is accessed. E.g. the token based
#   authorization verifies that the request contains a
#   cryptographically signed token from a trusted source.
#
#   Once the request is authorized it is subject to further
#   authorization by other components in dCache, e.g. PnfsManager or
#   PoolManager. Those authorizations happen wrt. the identity defined
#   by xrootd.authz.user.
#
#   The default is 'nobody', meaning that only world-permissible
#   operations are allowed. Other valid values are 'root' (no further
#   authorization) and a string on the form UID:GID[,GID...], i.e. a
#   numerical UID followed by one or more numerical GIDs. The first
#   GID is the primary one.
#
xrootd.authz.user = nobody

#  ---- Upload directory
#
#   The xrootd door restricts access to the user's root directory (as defined
#   by gPlazma). The upload directory is an exception to this rule. The directory
#   is typically used by SRM for uploading files.
#
#   If the property is defined to a relative path, it is interpreted relative to
#   the account's root directory.
#
xrootd.authz.upload-directory=${dcache.upload-directory}


#  ---- Mover queue
#
#   The mover queue on the pool to which this request will be
#   scheduled.
#
xrootd.mover.queue =

#  ---- Mover queue timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds after which the xrootd door
#   gives up on waiting for a mover to start. This places a bound on
#   the maximum mover queue time.
#
xrootd.mover.timeout = 180000
(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)xrootd.mover.timeout.unit=MILLISECONDS

#  ----- Custom kXR_Qconfig responses
#
#   xrootd clients may query the server configuration using a kXR_Qconfig request.
#   These key value pairs can be queried. Additional key value pairs may be added as
#   needed, see the xrootd protocol specification at http://xrootd.org/ for details.
