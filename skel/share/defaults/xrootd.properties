#   A service can consume messages from named queues. Other services can

# the backend service.
#
# If enabled, the proxy injects the actual clients IP address into the data
# stream, thus letting the backend be aware of the clients address.

# xrootd door.

##  This property is a space-separated list of hostnames or IP
##  addresses to publish for this door.  Hostnames are resolved to an
##  IP address on start-up, but not subsequently.  Non-wildcard IP
##  addresses are resolved to canonical name on start-up, but not
##  subsequently.  Wildcard IP addresses (0.0.0.0 or ::) are replaced
##  by a dynamically discovered list of IP addresses, based on which
##  network interfaces are "up".  These are resolved, with the
##  corresponding hostnames cached for a configurable period (see
##  'networkaddress.cache.ttl' system property).  An empty value is
##  equivalent to "0.0.0.0".

#
#   These parameters are set to the absolute paths of directories
#   accessible through Xrootd. Multiple directories are separated by a
#   colon. Different directories may be specified for reads and
#   writes. An empty list will disallow access to all directories.
#
#   The writable paths should likely include any upload directory used

#  ---- Xrootd plugins
#
#   Comma separated list of plugins to inject into the xrootd
#   request processing chain.
#
#   dCache ships with a few plugins:
#
#    gplazma:none - no authentication is performed; user identity is
#                   set to ${xrootd.authz.user} (door only).
#
#    gplazma:gsi  - any xrootd request to the door will use a key-exchange
#                   process to identify the end-user (door only).
#
#    authz:alice-token - ALICE token based authorization plugin.
#
#   A gplazma:* authentication plugin is required; use
#   gplazma:none if no authentication is desired. Authorization plugins
#   have to be placed after the authentication plugin.
#
#   Third party plugins can be used by adding the plugin to the plugin
#   directory of dCache and specifying the plugin name here. Note that
#   third party authentication plugins have to be loaded with
#   gplazma:<plugin>.
#
#   NOTE:  the access-log plugin, which generates a dCache style access log
#          using the NetLogger format, is now added automatically.
#
xrootd.plugins=gplazma:none,authz:none

#  ---- User identity used for authorizing operations
#
#   As xrootd requests are not authenticated, an identity has to be
#   chosen for authorizing operations. All operations are performed as
#   this identity.
#
#   The authorization controlled by this parameter is different from
#   the authorization performed by the authorization plugin: The
#   authorization plugin validates the requests themselves
#   independently of the file which is accessed. E.g. the token based
#   authorization verifies that the request contains a
#   cryptographically signed token from a trusted source.
#
#   Once the request is authorized it is subject to further
#   authorization by other components in dCache, e.g. PnfsManager or
#   PoolManager. Those authorizations happen wrt. the identity defined
#   by xrootd.authz.user.
#
#   The default is 'nobody', meaning that only world-permissible
#   operations are allowed. Other valid values are 'root' (no further
#   authorization) and a string on the form UID:GID[,GID...], i.e. a
#   numerical UID followed by one or more numerical GIDs. The first
#   GID is the primary one.
#
xrootd.authz.user = nobody

#   The access level granted to users who supply valid credentials but
#   who are not mapped to a dCache user.  FULL and READONLY allow such
#   users to access dCache as the anonymous user, while NONE rejects
#   such authentication attempts.
#
#   FULL and READONLY differ in how dCache handles requests that could
#   modify content: FULL will make the usual authorisation decisions
#   (e.g., checking the namespace), while READONLY will always fail
#   operations that could modify dCache.
#
(one-of?NONE|READONLY|FULL)xrootd.authz.anonymous-operations = NONE


#  ---- Mover queue
#
#   The mover queue on the pool to which this request will be
#   scheduled.
#

#  ---- Mover queue timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds after which the xrootd door
#   gives up on waiting for a mover to start. This places a bound on
#   the maximum mover queue time.

(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)xrootd.mover.timeout.unit=MILLISECONDS

#  ----- Custom kXR_Qconfig responses
#
#   xrootd clients may query the server configuration using a kXR_Qconfig request.
#   These key value pairs can be queried. Additional key value pairs may be added as
#   needed, see the xrootd protocol specification at http://xrootd.org/ for details.

xrootd.security.force-signing=${dcache.xrootd.security.force-signing}

#  ----- Per-application io-queues
#
#   xrootd protocol allows clients to identify the name of their
#   application.  By default this is the name of the executable (e.g.,
#   xrdcp is "xrdcp") but the xrootd library allows the client to send
#   a different value.  The xrootd.app-ioqueue prefix allows the door
#   to select an io-queue based on this supplied name; the key is the
#   application name and the value is the io-queue name.  For example,
#   with the following definition transfers that involve the xrdcp
#   client will use the "stream" io-queue:
#
#       xrootd.app-ioqueue!xrdcp = stream
#
