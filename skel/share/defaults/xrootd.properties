##  addresses are resolved to canonical name on start-up, but not
##  subsequently.  Wildcard IP addresses (0.0.0.0 or ::) are replaced
##  by a dynamically discovered list of IP addresses, based on which
##  network interfaces are "up".  These are resolved, with the

#

xrootd.authz.write-paths =

#  ---- Xrootd plugins
#
#   Comma separated list of plugins to inject into the xrootd
#   request processing chain.
#
#   dCache ships with a few plugins:
#
#    gplazma:none - no authentication is performed; user identity is
#                   set to ${xrootd.authz.user} (door only).
#
#    gplazma:gsi  - any xrootd request to the door will use a key-exchange
#                   process to identify the end-user (door only).
#
#    gplazma:ztn  - only the client's ability to provide a valid token
#                   is checked, but the user's identity may or may not
#                   be set, depending on the strength and details of the
#                   token.   The identity established here may be overridden
#                   by a downstream authorization token; conversely, if
#                   there is no authorization token, authorization defaults
#                   to the restrictions established here at authentication.
#
#    authz:alice-token - ALICE token based authorization plugin.
#    authz:scitokens   - JWT/Scitoken based authorization plugin.
#    authz:none        - no further authorization done after login.
#
#   Authentication plugins may be chained; at least one is required.
#   The order is meaningful, in that the client will be given the
#   protocols to try one after the other in that order.  The 'gplazma:none'
#   plugin should always be the last element in the gplazma list, but it
#   can also be suppressed if anonymous login is not desired.
#
#   (NOTE:  as of this writing [04/2022], third-party-copy with
#   tokens is only supported in general by allowing the
#   third-party-copy client to connect to the source without
#   authentication, so if the door is expected to serve as TPC
#   source, the 'gplazma:none' plugin must be included in the list.
#   This is subject to change in the future.)
#
#   Authorization plugins have to be placed after the authentication plugins;
#   currently only one can be loaded at a time. This may be subject to change.
#
#   Third party plugins can be used by adding the plugin to the plugin
#   directory of dCache and specifying the plugin name here. Note that
#   third party authentication plugins have to be loaded with
#   gplazma:<plugin>.
#
#   NOTE:  the access-log plugin, which generates a dCache style access log
#          using the NetLogger format, is now added automatically.
#
xrootd.plugins=gplazma:ztn,gplazma:gsi,gplazma:none,authz:scitokens

#   ---- User identity used for authorizing operations
#
#   When xroot requests are not authenticated (='none', above),
#   an identity has to be chosen for authorizing operations.
#   In this case, all operations are performed using this identity.
#
#   The authorization controlled by this parameter is different from
#   the authorization performed by the authorization plugin: The
#   authorization plugin validates the requests themselves
#   independently of the file which is accessed. E.g. the token based
#   authorization verifies that the request contains a
#   cryptographically signed token from a trusted source.
#
#   Once the request is authorized it is subject to further
#   authorization by other components in dCache, e.g. PnfsManager or
#   PoolManager. Those authorizations happen wrt. the identity defined
#   by xrootd.authz.user.  NOTE, however, that some token-based
#   authorization (such as scitokens) can use the claims in the token
#   to override the internal ACLs and restrictions.
#
#   The default user is 'nobody', meaning that only world-permissible
#   operations are allowed. Other valid values are 'root' (no further
#   authorization) and a string of the form UID:GID[,GID...], i.e., a
#   numerical UID followed by one or more numerical GIDs. The first
#   GID is the primary one.
#
xrootd.authz.user = nobody

#   The access level granted to users who supply valid credentials but
#   who are not mapped to a dCache user.  FULL and READONLY allow such
#   users to access dCache as the anonymous user, while NONE rejects
#   such authentication attempts.
#
#   FULL and READONLY differ in how dCache handles requests that could
#   modify content: FULL will make the usual authorisation decisions
#   (e.g., checking the namespace), while READONLY will always fail
#   operations that could modify dCache.
#
(one-of?NONE|READONLY|FULL)xrootd.authz.anonymous-operations = NONE

#  ---- Mover queue
#
#   The mover queue on the pool to which this request will be
#   scheduled.
#
xrootd.mover.queue =

#  ---- Mover queue timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds after which the xrootd door
#   gives up on waiting for a mover to start. This places a bound on
#   the maximum mover queue time.
#

(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)xrootd.mover.timeout.unit=MILLISECONDS

#  ----- Custom kXR_Qconfig responses
#
#   xroot clients may query the server configuration using a
#   kXR_Qconfig request.  These key value pairs can be
#   queried. Additional key value pairs may be added as needed, see
#   the xroot protocol specification at http://xrootd.org/ for
#   details.

xrootd.query-config!role = none

#  ----- Whether the door passes the xrootd 'tried' cgi to the PoolManager
#
#        This option is used by the xrootd client to indicate to an xroot
#        manager-role server that it wishes to exclude data servers on the
#        given host because a previous attempt to use it failed.
#
#        The list of hosts is ignored by dCache pool selection in the following cases:
#
#        1. when it is not enabled
#        2. when the client has not provided a 'triedrc' (error code giving the reason)
#        3. when the error code is other than 'enoent' (file not found) or 'ioerr'
#
#        It is recommended that if this option is activated, you make sure
#        that all doors and pools that could be used as a third-party copy
#        source support TLS (strict or optional) if the client is to be
#        used with the 'xroots' protocol.  This is because the vanilla xrootd
#        third-party copy will send a retried=<host> back to the door if
#        it expects to use TLS and TLS fails.  When this happen, if the file
#        has replicas only on that host, the client will retry uselessly until it
#        times out.  Otherwise, setting this to false would be advisable.

#  TLS OPTIONS
#
#      mode:        whether tls is running and is required
#      login:       start tls right after the protocol handshake
#      session:     start tls after the authentication/login phase
#      tpc:         use TLS on tpc (see below for explanation)
#      data:        protect the data channel if opened (currently not supported)
#      gpf:         protect the GP file (currently not supported)
#
#      NOTE     that the login, session, tpc, data, and gpf options only have a bearing
#               on the endpoint behavior if the mode is set to STRICT.  With OPTIONAL,
#               if the client forces/requests TLS, it is turned on at login; otherwise,
#               TLS is not started.
#
#      The configuration of TLS on the door (and pool) can vary according
#      to requirements.   To illustrate, here are three possible settings
#      which might be commonly used:
#
#      [1]          plugins:gplazma:gsi...
#                   tls.mode=OPTIONAL
#
#                   The client will always be required to login with GSI,
#                   whether it supports TLS or not.  The door will turn on TLS if
#                   requested by the client (i.e., 'xroots://my-xroot-door.example.org/...').
#
#      [2]          plugins:gplazma:gsi...
#                   tls.mode=STRICT
#                   tls.require-session=true
#
#                   If the client does not support TLS, it is refused.
#                   Otherwise, it will login with GSI and then go to TLS.
#
#      [3]          plugins:gplazma:none...
#                   tls.mode=STRICT
#                   tls.require-login=true
#
#                   If the client does not support TLS, it is refused.
#                   Otherwise it will go to TLS before logging in.
#
#                   Of course, given that this latter case does not authenticate,
#                   users will have to be mapped via some authorization mechanism.
#                   This probably is the setting most appropriate for
#                   token authorization.
#
#      Each of the 'require' properties corresponds to an xrootd flag.
#      login includes session, though it is not necessary to set both to
#      true in that case (only login); however, setting both to false is
#      also meaningful if one only wishes to protect, for instance, just data
#      connections (this is not yet supported, but may be in the future).
#
#      The 'require-tpc' flag works slightly differently from the others
#      in that it serves to indicate that clients that do not support TLS
#      cannot do TPC, though they may be allowed to do two-party transfers
#      (provided none of the other flags are set to true).
#
#      Note again that these flags only have meaning when the mode is STRICT.
#
#      Signed hash verification and TLS are held to be mutually exclusive.
#      If TLS is activated, signed hash verification is turned off automatically,
#      whether the server has been set to use it otherwise or not.  TLS is
#      more expensive than hash-signing, but also more secure (hash-signing
#      does not encrypt the actual data; it is simply a more lightweight
#      countermeasure to man-in-the-middle attacks).  Nevertheless,
#      minimal protection may on occasion be preferable to the more expensive
#      option, in which case TLS can be deactivated for the door/pool by
#      setting mode to OFF.
#
#      NB: because the default is OPTIONAL, host cert/key will be required on
#          the door node.  If it is not there, the domain will not start.
#          Only with this option set to OFF will the domain now start without the cert/key.

#  ----- Per-application io-queues

#   xrdcp is "xrdcp") but the xrootd library allows the client to send
#   a different value.  The xrootd.app-ioqueue prefix allows the door
#   to select an io-queue based on this supplied name; the key is the
#   application name and the value is the io-queue name.  For example,
#   with the following definition transfers that involve the xrdcp
#   client will use the "stream" io-queue:
