#   dCache will try to verify the integrity of transferred data by
#   comparing locally generated checksum values with that obtained
#   from the remote server.  If the transfer protocol is HTTP then RFC
#   3230 allows dCache to discover checksums for the remote file.
#   With this, dCache can learn if the file was corrupted during
#   transfer.  If the remote server supports RFC 3230 and the remote
#   server uses a compatible checksum algorithm then dCache will
#   always verify the data integrity.
#
#   Although dCache supports RFC 3230, most HTTP and WebDAV servers
#   currently do not.  It is also possible that, although the remote
#   server supports RFC 3230, the supplied checksum cannot be used by
#   dCache.  When transferring data with such a server, dCache can
#   either transfer the file's data without checksum verification or
#   fail the request.
#
#   The RequireChecksumVerification HTTP header allows the client to
#   control whether checksum verification is required.  dCache accepts
#   the this header with values of 'true' or 'false'.  If 'true' then
#   checksum verification is required for the transfers and the
#   failure to obtain a suitable checksum will fail the transfer.  If
#   'false' then dCache will still attempt to verify data integrety
#   but the transfer will not fail because of dCache was unable to
#   verify the data integrety by checking a checksum.

#

#  ---- Whether to redirect GET requests to a pool
#
#   If true, WebDAV doors will respond with a 302 redirect pointing to
#   a pool holding the file. This requires that a pool can accept
#   incoming TCP connections and that the client follows the
#   redirect. If false, data is relayed through the door. The door
#   will establish a TCP connection to the pool.
#
#   Note: by default, a WebDAV door will redirect to HTTP, not HTTPS.

#   will establish a TCP connection to the pool. Only clients that send
#   a Expect: 100-Continue header will be redirected - other requests

#   false, attempts to overwrite existing files will be denied.

# ---- Provide template configuration.
#
#  dCache uses String Template to generate directory listings and

#  default.
#
#  dCache comes with a default template.  Some elements of that
#  template be configured through the standard dCache configuration.
#  This allows sites to use the default template if only minor changes
#  are necessary.  It also allows sites to reuse information already
#  provided in dCache configuration, avoiding unnecessary duplication.
#
#  A custom template may have any number of attributes --- one for
#  each dCache property that starts 'webdav.templates.config!'.
#  Within the template, the 'config' attribute contains all these
#  values with the key being the remainder of the dCache property name
#  after the '!'.  For example the expression '$config.foo$' in a
#  template will expand to the value of dCache property
