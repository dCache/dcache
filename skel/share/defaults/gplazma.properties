#     Default values for gPlazma configuration
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
@DEFAULTS_HEADER@


#  ---- Name of the gPlazma cell
#
#  The name gPlazma will use when running.
gplazma.cell.name=gPlazma


#  ---- Number of concurrent requests to process.
#
#  The number of login requests that gPlazma will process
#  concurrently.  Setting this number too high may result in large
#  spikes of CPU activity and the potential to run out of memory.
#  Setting the number too lower results in potentially slow login
#  activity.
#
(deprecated)gPlazmaNumberOfSimultaneousRequests=30
gplazma.cell.limits.threads=${gPlazmaNumberOfSimultaneousRequests}


#  ---- Whether to export the gPlazma cell as a well known cell
#
#  This property controls whether the gPlazma cell is published as
#  a well known cell. Well known cells are addressable through their
#  cell name, while other cells are only addressable from other domains
#  using their fully qualified cell address.
#
#  Sometimes one may want to have a local gPlazma instance used by
#  doors in the same domain. This can be achieved by adding the gplazma
#  service to such a domain and setting the gplazma.cell.export property
#  to false. In past versions of dCache, this has been referred to
#  as using gPlazma as a module.
#
(one-of?true|false)gplazma.cell.export=true

#  ---- Location of the configuration file
#
#  The location of the gPlazma configuration file.  This controls
#  which plugins are used to authenticate end-users, in which order
#  and how the plugins are configured.
#
gplazma.configuration.file=${dcache.paths.etc}/gplazma.conf

#  Cell address of pnfsmanager service
gplazma.service.pnfsmanager=${dcache.service.pnfsmanager}

#         Properties for gPlazma plugins
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#  ---- Path of the grid-mapfile file
gplazma.gridmap.file=${dcache.paths.grid-security}/grid-mapfile

#  ---- Path of the storage-authzdb file
gplazma.authzdb.file=${dcache.paths.grid-security}/storage-authzdb

#  ---- Mapping order for determining the UID
#
#  The storage-authzdb file maps names to UID, one or more GIDs, and a
#  number of attributes.
#
#  The authzdb plugin is typically used with other plugins and map
#  user credentials to user and group names. Typical examples are
#  gridmap (maps DN to user name) and vorolemap (maps FQAN to group
#  name). The authzdb plugin maps both user names and group names to
#  UID and GIDs.
#
#  The authzdb plugin can be configured how it selects the mapping
#  that determines the UID to use. The property is an ordered comma
#  separated list of shortcuts of principal that are consulted to
#  select among several possible mappings. The available principle
#  shortcuts are:
#
#   uid Some protocols (specifically DCAP) allow the client to specify
#       a UID explicitly. The UID can be used to disambiguate between
#       several available mappings. Note that a client provided UID is
#       not in itself enough to authorize use of a mapping.
#
#   login Some protocols (DCAP, FTP, among others) allow a login name
#         to be specified in addition to regular X.509 or Kerberos
#         authentication. The login name may be used to disambiguate
#         between several available mappings. Note that a client
#         provided login name is not in itself enough to authorize use
#         of a mapping.
#
#   user The authzdb plugin is always combined with other plugins,
#        such as the gridmap plugin. Such plugins map may map to user
#        names, which both authorize the use of a mapping in
#        storage-authzdb and may determine the mapping being used.
#
#   group The authzdb plugin is always combined with other plugins,
#        such as the vorolemap plugin. Such plugins map may map to
#        group names, which both authorize the use of a mapping in
#        storage-authzdb and may determine the mapping being used. In
#        this case the primary group name will determine the mapping
#        from which the UID is taken.
#
#  With the default setting tha set of candidate mappings (the
#  mappings the user is authorized to use) is determined by the user
#  and group names generated by other plugin (eg gridmap and
#  vorolemap). To select one of the mappings, a user provided UID is
#  consulted; if not avilable a user provided login name is consulted;
#  if not available the mapping of a user name generated by another
#  plugin is consulted (eg gridmap); if not available the mapping of a
#  primary group name generated by another plugin is consulted (eg
#  vorolemap).
#
#  A typical reason to change the default is if one wants to give
#  priority to the group name mapping rather than the user name
#  mapping; Eg when combined with gridmap and vorolemap, changing this
#  property to uid,login,group,user means that the primary group name
#  as generated by vorolemap determines the UID and only if that is
#  not available will the user name generated by gridmap be used.
#
gplazma.authzdb.uid=uid,login,user,group

#  ---- Mapping order for determining the primary GID
#
#  Similar to gplazma.authzdb.uid, but determines how the primary GID
#  is selected. The same principal shortcuts are available, with the
#  exception of uid; instead a user provided GID is consulted when the
#  gid shortcut is used.
#
#  A typical reason to change the default is if one wants to give
#  priority to the user name mapping rather than the group name
#  mapping; Eg when combined with gridmap and vorolemap, changing this
#  property to gid,login,user,group means that the user name as
#  generated by gridmap determines the primary GID and only if that is
#  not available will the primary group name generated by vorolemap be
#  used.

gplazma.authzdb.gid=gid,login,group,user

# The search filter to use to locate a user's entry in the LDAP directory.
# It must contain the special token "%s" which will be replaced with the

#
# The LDAP session plugin assigns two directories to the user's session:
# The root directory, which is the root of the directory hierarchy visible
# to the user and the home directory, which is the directory the user starts
# his session in. In "normal" mode (this is the default), the root directory
# is set to "/" and the home directory is set to "%homeDirectory%", thus the
# user starts his session in the home directory, as it is stored on the LDAP
# server, and is able to go up in the directory hierarchy to "/".
# For a different use-case, for example if dCache is used as a cloud storage
# it may not be wanted that the users can see more than their own storage space.
# For this use case home-dir can be set to "/" and root-dir be set to
# "%homeDirectory".
#
# In both variables %homeDirectory% will be replaced by the user's home
# directory as it is stored on the LDAP server.
