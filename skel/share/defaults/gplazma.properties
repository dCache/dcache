#     Default values for gPlazma configuration
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   This Java properties file contains default values for gPlazma
#   configuration parameters. All values can be redefined in
#   etc/dcache.conf. Do not modify any values here as your changes
#   will be lost when you next upgrade.



#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Common properties
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  gPlazma comes in two versions: the one available before 1.9.12
#  (gPlazma-1) and the new gPlazma (gPlazma-2).  This section contains
#  options that apply equally to gPlazma-1 or gPlazma-2.
#

#  ---- The gPlazma version to run
#
#  Valid values are "1" and "2".  Selecting "1" chooses gPlazma-1, the
#  implementation of gPlazma available in dCache versions prior to
#  1.9.12.  Selecting "2" chooses the new gPlazma.
#
(obsolete)gplazma.version = gplazma 1 and 2 integrated into a single component.


#  ---- Name of the gPlazma cell
#
#  The name gPlazma will use when running.  This name will be
#  registered as well-known to other services.  This is important if
#  you wish to run multiple gPlazma cells as they will need different
#  names.
#
gplazma/cell.name=gPlazma


#  ---- Number of concurrent requests to process.
#
#  The number of login requests that gPlazma will process
#  concurrently.  Setting this number too high may result in large
#  spikes of CPU activity and the potential to run out of memory.
#  Setting the numebr too lower results in potentially slow login
#  activity.
#
gPlazmaNumberOfSimultaneousRequests=30


#  ---- Use gPlazma as a module
#
#  This property controls whether an extra gplazma service is run in
#  the door's domain.  This extra gplazma service is not well-known,
#  so doors located in other domains will not use it.  The local
#  gPlazma may be used for load-balancing or to supply domain-specific
#  gPlazma configuration (e.g., authorising additional access).
#
#  Note that configuring a domain to host both a door configured with
#  gPlazma as a module and the global 'gplazma' service is not
#  supported.
#
#  Specifying 'true' starts an extra gplazma service, as described
#  above.
#
#  Specifying 'false' has no effect.
#
(one-of?true|false)useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule=false


#  ---- Use the centralised gPlazma service
#
#  This property controls whether a door will use the central gplazma
#  service or a local kpwd file when authenticating a user.  It
#  affects the FTP doors (ftp, gridftp, kerberosftp).
#
#  If the property is set to 'true' then the door will use the
#  'gplazma' service to authenticate and map a user.
#
#  If 'false' then a kpwd file is used instead.  The kpwdFile property
#  must point to a valid kpwd file.
#
(one-of?true|false)useGPlazmaAuthorizationCell=true


#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Properties for gPlazma
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  The following properties are for the version of gPlazma
#  available with 1.9.12 and later.
#

#  ---- Location of the configuration file
#
#  The location of the gPlazma configuration file.  This controls
#  which plugins are used to authenticate end-users, in which order
#  and how the plugins are configured.
#
gplazma.configuration.file=${dcache.paths.etc}/gplazma.conf

#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Properties for gPlazma 2 plugins
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#  ---- Path of the grid-mapfile file
gplazma.gridmap.file=${grid.path}/grid-mapfile

#  ---- Path of the storage-authzdb file
gplazma.authzdb.file=${grid.path}/storage-authzdb

#  ---- Mapping order for determining the UID
#
#  The storage-authzdb file maps names to UID, one or more GIDs, and a
#  number of attributes.
#
#  The authzdb plugin is typically used with other plugins and map
#  user credentials to user and group names. Typical examples are
#  gridmap (maps DN to user name) and vorolemap (maps FQAN to group
#  name). The authzdb plugin maps both user names and group names to
#  UID and GIDs.
#
#  The authzdb plugin can be configured how it selects the mapping
#  that determines the UID to use. The property is an ordered comma
#  separated list of shortcuts of principal that are consulted to
#  select among several possible mappings. The available principle
#  shortcuts are:
#
#   uid Some protocols (specifically DCAP) allow the client to specify
#       a UID explicitly. The UID can be used to disambiguate between
#       several available mappings. Note that a client provided UID is
#       not in itself enough to authorize use of a mapping.
#
#   login Some protocols (DCAP, FTP, among others) allow a login name
#         to be specified in addition to regular X.509 or Kerberos
#         authentication. The login name may be used to disambiguate
#         between several available mappings. Note that a client
#         provided login name is not in itself enough to authorize use
#         of a mapping.
#
#   user The authzdb plugin is always combined with other plugins,
#        such as the gridmap plugin. Such plugins map may map to user
#        names, which both authorize the use of a mapping in
#        storage-authzdb and may determine the mapping being used.
#
#   group The authzdb plugin is always combined with other plugins,
#        such as the vorolemap plugin. Such plugins map may map to
#        group names, which both authorize the use of a mapping in
#        storage-authzdb and may determine the mapping being used. In
#        this case the primary group name will determine the mapping
#        from which the UID is taken.
#
#  With the default setting tha set of candidate mappings (the
#  mappings the user is authorized to use) is determined by the user
#  and group names generated by other plugin (eg gridmap and
#  vorolemap). To select one of the mappings, a user provided UID is
#  consulted; if not avilable a user provided login name is consulted;
#  if not available the mapping of a user name generated by another
#  plugin is consulted (eg gridmap); if not available the mapping of a
#  primary group name generated by another plugin is consulted (eg
#  vorolemap).
#
#  A typical reason to change the default is if one wants to give
#  priority to the group name mapping rather than the user name
#  mapping; Eg when combined with gridmap and vorolemap, changing this
#  property to uid,login,group,user means that the primary group name
#  as generated by vorolemap determines the UID and only if that is
#  not available will the user name generated by gridmap be used.
#
gplazma.authzdb.uid=uid,login,user,group

#  ---- Mapping order for determining the primary GID
#
#  Similar to gplazma.authzdb.uid, but determines how the primary GID
#  is selected. The same principal shortcuts are available, with the
#  exception of uid; instead a user provided GID is consulted when the
#  gid shortcut is used.
#
#  A typical reason to change the default is if one wants to give
#  priority to the user name mapping rather than the group name
#  mapping; Eg when combined with gridmap and vorolemap, changing this
#  property to gid,login,user,group means that the user name as
#  generated by gridmap determines the primary GID and only if that is
#  not available will the primary group name generated by vorolemap be
#  used.
#
gplazma.authzdb.gid=gid,login,group,user
