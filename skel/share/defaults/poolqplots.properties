#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#     The following properties control the creation of pool queue
#     histograms via a round-robin database (org.rrd4j)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   This Java properties file contains default values for pool queue plotting
#   configuration parameters. All values can be redefined in
#   etc/dcache.conf. Do not modify any values here as your changes
#   will be lost when you next upgrade.

#  ---- Turn on periodic pool queue information collection
#
(one-of?true|false)poolqplots.enabled=false

#  ---- How often the collection should be run (minimum)
#
poolqplots.refresh-interval=5

#  ---- Time Unit for min delay
#
(one-of?SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)poolqplots.refresh-interval-unit=MINUTES

#  ---- Type of image file to produce
#
poolqplots.rrdb.image-type=png

#  ---- Height of the plot image in pixels
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.height=800

#  ---- Width of the plot image in pixels
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.width=1200

#  ---- Label precision; if the format were exact, this would be 0, but since
#       the default unit is DAYS, we use 24 so that the label gets centered
#       at noon (12) rather than at midnight
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.label-span=24

#  ---- Unit for placing X-axis labels
#
(one-of?MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)poolqplots.rrdb.plot.label-unit=DAYS

#  ---- Number of label units between labels
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.label-unit-count=2

#  ---- Unit for placing X-axis major grid lines
#
(one-of?MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)poolqplots.rrdb.plot.major-unit=DAYS

#  ---- Number of major grid units between major grid lines
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.major-unit-count=1

#  ---- Unit for placing X-axis minor grid lines
#       (set to be the same as major grid lines for less clutter)
#
(one-of?MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)poolqplots.rrdb.plot.minor-unit=DAYS

#  ---- Number of minor grid units between minor grid lines
#       (set to be the same as major grid lines for less clutter)
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.minor-unit-count=1

#  ---- Number of extra steps to show on the right margin
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.right-margin=3

#  ---- Format for displaying the date/time as X-axis label
#       This follows strftime conventions except that the '%' marker is not used
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.x-label-format=E MMM dd YYYY HH:mm

#  ---- How wide the histogram X-axis should be
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.span-size=15

#  ---- Unit for the histogram X-axis span calculation
#
(one-of?MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)poolqplots.rrdb.plot.span-unit=DAYS

#  ---- The histogram X-axis minimum time step; this will usually be the same
#       as 'poolqplots.rrdb.min-delay'
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.step-size=5

#  ---- Unit for the histogram X-axis minimum time step
#
(one-of?MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)poolqplots.rrdb.plot.step-unit=MINUTES

#  ---- Round-robin database version number
#
poolqplots.rrdb.db.version=2

#  ---- Label which should appear on the Y-axis
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.y-label=Threads

#  ---- The rrd4j heartbeat is the timespan (in seconds) which determines
#       whether a data value is valid and can be used to compute the
#       value at the current consolidation point.  If an update comes
#       after the heartbeat, the value for that point is considered unknown.
#       We compute the heartbeat on the basis of the step, multiplying it by
#       this factor.
#
poolqplots.rrdb.plot.heartbeat-factor=1.5
