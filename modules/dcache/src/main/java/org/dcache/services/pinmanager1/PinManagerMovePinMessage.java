/**
 * Request to pin manager to move pins from one pool to another.
 * <p>
 * Since it is really up to the pin manager to decide where to pin a file, this message is to be
 * considered a weak request. The request is considered successful if at the end of the operation
 * the file is no longer pinned on the specified source pool. Whether the file was actually pinned
 * on that pool in the first place or pinned at all is not important.
 * <p>
 * It is not important whether the file is pinned on the target pool after the operation. The target
 * pool is only to be considered a hint about where to move the pin.
 * <p>
 * The list of sticky records is also just a hint. The pin manager should assume that those sticky
 * records actually exist on the source pool and attempt to clear them. If the pin manager has
 * knowledge about any other sticky records on the source pool, then it should remove those too.
