 * removal of a StateWatcher from the group, listing the current members of
 * the group and disabling and enabling these members.
 * <p>
 * A StateObservatory allows a StateCaretaker to inform StateWatchers of any
 * StateTransitions that satisfy the StateWatcher's interest. As a special

 * that maintain derived metrics) may wish to update metric values as a
