/**
 * Send inotify events for this file.
 * <p>
 * In the Linux version, an IN_ACCESS or IN_MODIFY event is generated for each read(2) (or similar)
 * call or write(2) (or similar) call, respectively.
 * <p>
 * dCache could do likewise; however, on a busy system, this is (almost certainly) too many events.
 * Therefore this class has the facility to suppress subsequent events for the same operation (read
 * or write).  For example, if a client is only reading then the first IN_ACCESS event is sent, but
 * the subsequent events are suppressed.
 * <p>
 * The suppression is time-limited: if the client is continously only reading or only writing then,
 * after a configurable duration, an IN_ACCESS or IN_MODIFY event (respectively) is generated.
 * Subsequent events are again suppressed for the configured duration.  This allows the inotify
 * client to distinguish between a file with active IO from one that is opened but idle.
 * <p>
 * If the IO client changes from reading to writing (or vice verse) then the next event is sent,
 * irrespective of whether events are currently being suppressed.  The expectation is that, in
 * general, IO clients either read data exclusively or write data exclusively; in fact, (at the time
 * of writing) only the NFS protocol supports clients doing both, and only when creating the file.
 * Additionally, it is expected that even clients that both read and write files will have
 * relatively long phases within which they exclusively either read or write data.  Should this
 * assumption be wrong then the pool will generate large number of events, which may be problematic
 * and require revisiting these assumptions.
