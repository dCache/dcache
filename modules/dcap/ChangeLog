	  dcap: add storage capacity of string to url2config function
	  
	  The function url2config (in dcap_url.c) populates the memory
	  pointed to by one of the arguments with
	  the configuration option that would result in the supplied dcap
	  url structure. Currently, this
	  function blindly assumes there is sufficient memory to store the
	  necessary configuration string.
	  
	  This patch adds an additional argument to the url2config
	  function: the storage capacity of the
	  string memory allocated. The ordering of the arguments have been
	  changes to be more in keeping with
	  that of snprintf. The few places where url2config is called have
	  been updated.
	  
	  This patch does not affect url2config itself, so the assumption
	  of sufficient memory continues.

	* src/system_io.c: dcap: silence object-to-fn-ptr warnings when
	  compiling code
	  
	  When compiling dcap, the GCC compiler emits warnings like:
	  
	  system_io.c:231: warning: ISO C forbids conversion of object
	  pointer to function pointer type
	  
	  This is because we are converting an object pointer (returned by
	  dlsym() function), which we want to use as
	  a function pointer. This is arguably a bug in dlsym; however, we
	  need a work-around in order to silence
	  these warnings.
	  
	  The workaround is to declare a union that does the conversion.
	  This is guaranteed (ISO/IEC 9899:1990
	  "C89"/"C90") to match exactly.
	  
	  The same problem exists in at least one other file. Future patchs
	  should address further occurrences of
	  this problem.

	  Due to patch, http://rb.dcache.org/r/1646/ not detecting one to

	  "make rpm " target failed as the gsi tunnel was not packaged in
	  the RPM.
	  
	  This was because the decision to build the gsi tunnel was based
	  upon the globus header files being present and not requiring the
	  libraries to be present also. While the packaging of the RPM for
	  the gsi tunnel depended upon the globus header files being
	  present and requiring the libraries to also contain the
	  appropriate functions.

	  First stab at a test-suite for checking dcap's URL parser.
	  
	  Works like this: there are two types of file: foo.src and
	  foo.expected. The test framework
	  is invoked by typing "make test". This uses dcap_url-test, from
	  an earlier patch to build
	  foo.actual from foo.src and it then does a byte-wise comparison
	  between foo.actual and
	  foo.expected. If they are the same it goes onto the next file, if
	  not then the make process
	  will stop. Successful tests are recorded by touch foo.ok, so
	  repeated test-runs will skip
	  over those tests that have already passed. Doing "make clean"
	  clears all generated files.
	  
	  The Makefile in the directory modules/dcap/src/tests allows "make
	  test" to enter the listed
	  directories and do "make test" in each one. "make clean"
	  similarly cleans up.

	* configure.ac: BUG FIX : ./configure with no prefix set the prefix

	  Since we had to back port to support old versions of autoconf as
	  in RHEL and SL5 we had to set our own prefix handling.
	  
	  This was all fine but since autoconf defines ${prefix} as NONE if
	  not set and it then gets evaluated later, automake used the
	  templated value not the evaluated value of "/usr/local", all
	  worked as expected when --prefix was set.

	  AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM is used to detect the platform. Then if

	  in a single file without too much extras.

	  d) Restores the functionality of the per OS Make files in a

	  So with these serious issues not resolved why did I not make
	  these changes. Well the ant stuff is needed already, and its a
	  different subject and in my opinion should be in a different
	  patch that I haven't made yet. The #define issue is left to try
	  to minimize the differences in compilation till a later patch.
	  The other issues are all enhancements to what we have currently
	  and I feel are more incremental and I shoudl like to get them in
	  for follow up patches. Other issues will be addressed in a soon
	  to follow (after this is committed is a source code

	* dcache-dcap.spec: Fix to include path for
	  libdcap-tunnel-gsi-1.9.3-6.x86_64.rpm compilation against EPEL
	  
	  The main change is the fix to the include path, bypassing the
	  short cuts in the Make file.
	  
	  The make file could be simplified, (since I am bias toward the
	  EPEL distribution rather than VDT globus) but then the autotools
	  port is coming and so this is a for now solution requiring
	  minimal changes.
	  
	  While doing this I also included removing some Obsoletes, since
	  although all these packages do Obsolete the old name, since the
	  dcap package provides as well as obsoletes, it can cause issues
	  with
	  
	  yum groupinstall glite-UI
	  
	  when you want your rpms installed then do an upgrade. As some
	  times the libs declare that they obsolete the dcap binary rpm.
	  This is the sort of thing that should not happen and I assume its
	  a multi arch yum bug as it does not occur with sl5 i386 but that
	  could be because "groupinstall" is not set up.
