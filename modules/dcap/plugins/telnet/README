This directory contains the required code to handle telnet-like 
authorization for the dCapDoors. The plugin is compiled with 
"make" and the library can be used by setting the following two 
environment variables: 


DCACHE_IO_TUNNEL 		= specify the location of the plugin 
				  to be loaded by dccp and invoked 
				  on each communication with the door
DCACHE_IO_TUNNEL_TELNET_PWD 	= instructs the tunnel to use a file 
				  for reading the authorization tokens 
				  instead of the console (for Grid 
				  submission)
