/**
 * A FireAndForgetTask is a Task that will catch any Throwable that the Runnable may produce and
 * forward this to the Thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler. This is needed as the concurrency
 * package's Executors have a habit of wrapping tasks within Future objects, which catch Exceptions
 * so they can be reported when some Thread runs the get method of the Future.
 * <p>
 * This is problematic when one wishes to submit a request without recording the resulting Future
 * since any Exception is caught without ever being reported.
 * <p>
 * This Class will catch any Throwable and report it to the running Thread's
 * UncaughtExceptionHandler, thus ensuring that errors are propagated as expected.
