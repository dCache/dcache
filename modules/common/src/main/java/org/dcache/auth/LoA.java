 * Public credentials, such as a SAML assertion or an X.509 certificate carry
 * information about a person, such as their name.  When authenticating (and
 * ultimately authorising) a user, there should be some appreciation of the
 * likelihood that this information is wrong; for example, that the user has
 * stolen the corresponding private material (private key for X.509, usually
 * username & password for SAML), by establishing a false identity when
 * registering with the registrar (the Certificate Authority for X.509, the IdP
 * for SAML), or simply by authenticating with a mechanism where the registrar
 * does not investigate the person's identity.
 * <p>
 * Different profiles exist that provide some common appreciation of this risk.
