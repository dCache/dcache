 * This interface is used for asyncronous notification of SRM of the varios states of actions
 * performed  for "getting"file from the storage
 * <p>
 * Instance of this class is passed to implementation of AbstractStorageElement.prepareToGet(...)
 * method storage should call its methods in this order:
 * <p>
 * if error occured at any time, call GetStorageInfoFailed, SelectReadPoolFailed, PinRequestFailed,
 * Exception, Timeout or Error and do not make any further calls, nullify the reference to this
 * PrepareToGetCallbacks instance to allow garbage collection
 * <p>
 * if everything works fine, do the following, discover the info about the requested file create the
 * instance of the FileId for the requested file and call StorageInfoArrived with FileId and file
 * size as arguments
 * <p>
 * if StorageInfoArrived returns false no futher action is needed
 * <p>
 * if StorageInfoArrived returns true, file has to be brought to the fast access state (staged) .
 * once it is done call SelectReadPool with the name of the storage element that will host this file
 * after it is brought to the fast access state (staged) (name of the pool in case of dCache) the
 * AbstractStorageElement.unPinFile(FileId fileId,String pool) will be called with after the SRM
 * does not need this resource anymore.
 * <p>
 * if system does not support staging and pinning pass some arbitrary nonnull string.
 * <p>
 * If SelectReadPool returns false no futher action is needed
 * <p>
 * If SelectReadPool returns true, pin the file in the "fast access state" and call Pinned() if
 * system does not support pinning, just call Pinned() anyway
 * <p>
 * Keep the file in the pinned state untill
 * <p>
 * AbstractStorageElement.unPinFile(FileId fileId,String pool) is called.
