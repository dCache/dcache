/**
 * <p>Implementation of the {@link PoolTagConstraintDiscriminator} which returns
 * a list containing the pools or locations with zero weight.  The weights are computed in terms of
 * the sum of the size of the value partitions to which they belong.  For instance, if pool1 has
 * tag1 with value A and tag2 with value X, and A is shared by 3 other pools and X by 2, then pool1
 * has a weight of 5.</p>
 *
 * <p>The use case envisaged here is as follows:  the component has a set
 * of available locations from which it must choose one or more for replication. First, it will add
 * the tags of all current replica locations to the seenTags map. It will then run
 * getCandidateLocations() on the list one or more times, each time picking a location from the
 * returned list using some selection algorithm, removing this location from the available list and
 * adding its tags to the seenTags map, and finally passing the modified available list in to any
 * further iteration.</p>
