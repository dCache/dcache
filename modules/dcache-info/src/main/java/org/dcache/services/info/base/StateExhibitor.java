 * The class implementing StateExhibitor must ensure the self-consistency of the data produced. This
 * is likely achieved by holding some form of read-lock. It is desirable that these locks are not
 * held for an excessive time; therefore, it is important that the class implementing StateVisitor
 * does not undertake activity that is likely to block activity of the Thread for an unpredictable
