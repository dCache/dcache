/**
 * The SimpleSkeletonMapVisitor provides a simple framework for building a map between a list of
 * items and a particular metric within that list.  Although not abstract, this Class should not be
 * instantiated as it won't do anything useful!  Instead, a Class should extend this class for each
 * possible type of StateValue (the "metric").  This is to allow the metric type to be reflected in
 * the Map declaration.
 * <p>
 * To achieve this, the super-Class should override one of the visit*() methods, use
 * getPathToMetric() to test whether the metric is to be selected and getKey() as the key in the
 * corresponding Map.
 * <p>
 * The super-Class should also implement the getMap() method that should return a Map of the correct
 * type for the StateValue super-Class (metric type) under consideration.

     * Build a Map between a list of items and a metric value within that list.  To do this, two
     * paths must be specified.  The first path locates the parent StateComposite (branch) that the
     * list items share as their common parent: the keys in the resulting Map will be the names of
     * the StateComposites that are immediate children of the StateComposite given by the first
     * path.
     * <p>
     * The second path gives the relative path from a child of the parent StateComposite to the
     * metric under consideration.  If this is missing, no mapping is created.
     * <p>
     * For example, if the tree has String metrics like:
     * <pre>
     *   aa.bb.item1.cc.dd.value1
     *   aa.bb.item2.cc.dd.value2
     *   aa.bb.item3.cc.dd.value3
     * </pre>
     * Then supplying the paths aa.bb and cc.dd will result in a mapping with the following
     * Map.Entries:
     * <pre>  item1 --> value1
     *  item2 --> value2
     *  item3 --> value3
     * </pre>
     * Classes that extend this Class should implement a <code>getMap()</code> method.  This should
     * return a mapping between the key and the value and have the correct type.
