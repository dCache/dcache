     * The idea stolen from AFS:
     * <p>
     * Lookup, which allows a user to list the contents of the AFS directory, examine the ACL
     * associated with the directory and access subdirectories. Insert, which allows a user to add
     * new files or subdirectories to the directory. Delete, which allows a user to remove files and
     * subdirectories from the directory. Administer, which allows a user to change the ACL for the
     * directory. Users always have this right on their home directory, even if they accidentally
     * remove themselves from the ACL. Read, which allows a user to look at the contents of files in
     * a directory and list files in subdirectories. Files that are to be granted read access to any
     * user, including the owner, need to have the standard UNIX "owner read" permission set. This
     * can be done with the command chmod o+r filename. Write, which allows a user to modify files
     * in a directory. Files that are to be granted write access to any user, including the owner,
     * need to have the standard UNIX "owner write" permission set. This can be done with the chmod
     * o+w filename command. Lock, which allows the processor to run programs that need to "flock"
     * files in the directory. See the UNIX man page for "flock" for more details.
