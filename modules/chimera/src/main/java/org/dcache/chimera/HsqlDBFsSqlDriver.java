             *
             * We ought to maintain the link count in the inode, but Chimera has
             * not done so in the past. In the interest of avoiding costly schema
             * corrections in patch level releases, the current solution queries
             * for the existence of other links instead.
             *
             * The statement below relies on concurrent transactions not deleting
             * other links to affected tag inodes. Otherwise we could come into a
             * situation in which two concurrent transactions remove two links to
             * the same inode, yet none of them realize that the inode is left
             * without links (as there is another link).
             *
             * One way to ensure this would be to use repeatable read transaction
             * isolation, but PostgreSQL doesn't support changing the isolation level
             * in the middle of a transaction. Always running any operation that
             * might call this method with repeatable read was deemed unacceptable.
             * Another solution would be to lock the tag inode at the beginning of
             * this method using SELECT FOR UPDATE. This would be fairly expensive
             * way of solving this race.
             *
             * For now we decide to ignore the race: It seems unlikely to run into
             * and even if one does, the consequence is merely an orphaned inode.
