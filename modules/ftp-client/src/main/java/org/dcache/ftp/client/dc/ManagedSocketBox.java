/**
 * A container for Socket, making it available to pass a null socket reference.
 * <p>
 * We use asynchronously active connect task to initialize socket, and active start transfer task to
 * run it. We need to pass the socket reference, which is sometimes null (before initialization).
 * This is a sane way to do it; a simple socket container.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the box contains a flag that states whether the socket is currently in use, ie
 * whether it is assigned to some data channel. It is needed in GridFTP for data channel reuse.
