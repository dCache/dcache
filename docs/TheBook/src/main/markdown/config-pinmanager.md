THE PINMANAGER SERVICE
==================================

The purpose of the `pinmanager` service in dCache is ensuring the presence of a file replica on
disk.

It can be used by explicitly _(un)pinning_ files via the `admin` interface or the `bulk service`,
but is also used by the `resilience` component to ensure having a certain number of replicas
available. PinManager is also used for keeping a replica _online_ after fetching (staging) it from a
connected tertiary storage system (sometimes called HSM - hierarchical storage manager), if staging
is allowed.

## (Un-)Pinning Concept

A `pin`, also called `sticky`-ness, is a concept describing a file replica on a pool that cannot be
deleted for a certain duration. The pin effectively suppresses automatic garbage collection for the
lifetime of the pin.

Pins may have a finite or infinite lifetime. Pins also have an owner, which may be a dCache
service (such as `resilience`) or client through a protocol such as `srm`. Only the owner is allowed
to remove unexpired pins. Several pins (for different users) can exist for the same `pnfsid`, and a
file is considered pinned as long as at least one unexpired pin exists.

## The Pin Life Cycle

When a pin is created, it will initially appear in state `PINNING`, then transition to
state `PINNED` once the attempt is successful.

When a pin either has a finite lifetime that has expired or is directly requested to be removed, it
is put into state `READY_TO_UNPIN`. An 'unpinning' background task runs regularly (default every
minute), which directly removes all pins in state `READY_TO_UNPIN` that don't require pool contact,
then selects a certain number of pins (default 200) in state `READY_TO_UNPIN` for which the
corresponding pool needs to be contacted and attempts to remove them as well. During unpinning the
pins are in state `UNPINNING`.

On success, the pin is deleted from the pool in question as well as the database, on failure the pin
is put into state `FAILED_TO_UNPIN`. Another background process regularly (default every 2h) resets
all pins in state `FAILED_TO_UNPIN` back to state `READY_TO_UNPIN` in order to make them eligible to
be attempted again.

## Configuring

The PinManager service can be run in a shared domain. It may also be deployed in high availability (
HA) mode (coordinated via [ZooKeeper](config-zookeeper.md)) by having several PinManager cells in a
dCache instance, which then need to share the same database and configuration.

```
pinmanager.db.host=pinman-db-hostname
pinmanager.db.name=dcache
pinmanager.db.password=
pinmanager.db.user=dcache
```

Pins are managed in this central database as well as on the pools containing the replicas.

Pin expiration and pin unpinning are background tasks which are executed regularly. The
property `pinmanager.expiration-period` controls how often to execute these tasks. The default value
is 60 seconds.

The number of pins that should at most be attempted to be removed and necessitate pool contact per
unpinning task run can be configured with the property `pinmanager.max-unpins-per-run` and default
to 200. A value of -1 indicates that there is no limit, which might lead to large CPU and memory
loads if there are many pending unpin operations.

Another background task takes care of resetting pins that previously failed to be removed. It can be
configured via `pinmanager.reset-failed-unpins-period` and defaults to 2h.
