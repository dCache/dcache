Description: distributed mass storage system
 dCache is an efficient, modular and configurable mass storage

 huge amounts of data, distributed among a large number of heterogeneous server
 nodes, under a single virtual filesystem tree with a variety of standard
 access methods.
 .
 The GLUE info provider requires either xsltproc or libxml2-utils. The StAR
 accounting record provider requires python-psycopg2. The example HSM integration
 script requires ruby.
